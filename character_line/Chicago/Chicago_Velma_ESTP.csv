ESTP," Look at this, Mama. The Tribune calls me the Crime of the Year, and the News says, &ldquo;not in recent memory do we recall so fiendish and horrible a double homicide.&rdquo; I been on a lotta tours Mama. What kinda dough are we talkin&rsquo; about? Twenty five hundred?! The most me and Veronica ever made together was 350."
ESTP,"I always wanted to play Big Jim&rsquo;s - do you think you could get me that? Uh huh, and how much would that phone call cost?"
ESTP,Look I don&rsquo;t give no advice. You&rsquo;re a perfect stranger and I&rsquo;d prefer to keep it that way.
ESTP,That&rsquo;s about as corny as it gets. That I didn&rsquo;t do it! Well I&rsquo;m sure I don&rsquo;t know・Can&rsquo;t remember a thing - only I&rsquo;m sure I didn&rsquo;t do it; I&rsquo;ve got the tenderest heart in the world. Who&rsquo;s your lawyer?
ESTP,"Huh. Say Mama, would you be a dear and wake me for lunch?"
ESTP,"Mama, you know I&rsquo;m not a jealous person but every time I see that tomato&rsquo;s name in the paper it drives me nertz. Cancelled?!"
ESTP,"Say, I&rsquo;ve got an idea. Suppose I talk Hart into doing the sister act with me?"
ESTP,MY SISTER AND I HAD AN ACT THAT COULDN&rsquo;T FLOP. MY SISTER AND I WERE HEADED STRAIGHT FOR THE TOP. MY SISTER AND I EARNED A THOU A WEEK AT LEAST. BUT MY SISTER IS NOW UNFORTUNATELY DECEASED. I KNOW IT&rsquo;S SAD OF COURSE BUT A FACT IS STILL A FACT・ AND ALL THAT REMAINS IS THE REMAINS OF A PERFECT - DOUBLE - ACT.
ESTP,"Hear me out, and watch this. But you have to imagine it with two people. It&rsquo;s swell with two people. And we&rsquo;d say, &ldquo;Ok Fellas, keep your socks up, you ain&rsquo;t seen nothin&rsquo; yet!&rdquo;  And we&rsquo;d say, okay boys, we&rsquo;re going home・.but here&rsquo;s a few more partin&rsquo; shots! And this, this we did in perfect unison!!!"
ESTP,"Billy, I wanna discuss my trial too・There&rsquo;s only one person you can count on now Velma."
ESTP,AND ALL THAT JAZZ!
ESTP,"Well - am I glad to see you. Look・for my trial. Like &lsquo;em? But Billy! I been making all these plans・ Listen Flynn, I came up with 5 thousand dollars first. Ah what the heck. I&rsquo;ll be glad to get rid of her. But back to my trial・ Lemme just show you what I thought I might do on the witness stand・"
ESTP,"Well, when I get on the stand, I thought I&rsquo;d take a peek at the jury, and then I&rsquo;d cross my legs like this, you know."
ESTP,Then during cross examination I thought I&rsquo;d give &lsquo;em this. And then if he yells at me I thought I&rsquo;d tremble like this・
ESTP,"Then I thought I&rsquo;d let it all be too much for me, like real dramatic. Then I thought I&rsquo;d get real thirsty: &ldquo;Please someone, could i have a glass of water?"
ESTP,"Then I&rsquo;ll cry. Buckets. And Billy, I have to ask you for your handkerchief. I really like that bit・then I get up and try to walk, but I slump, and I slump and finally, I faint!"
ESTP,Thank you! Roxie and I would just to take this opportunity to thank each and every one of you!
ESTP,"You know, a lot of people have lost faith・ We&rsquo;d just like to thank our loyal fans!"
ESTP,"YOU CAN LIKE THE LIFE YOU&rsquo;RE LIVING - YOU CAN LIVE THE LIFE YOU LIKE. YOU CAN EVEN MARRY HARRY BUT MESS AROUND WITH IKE. AND THAT&rsquo;S GOOD, ISN&rsquo;T IT? GRAND, ISN&rsquo;T IT? GREAT, ISN&rsquo;T IT? SWELL, ISN&rsquo;T IT? SWELL, ISN&rsquo;T IT? FUN, ISN&rsquo;T IT? BUT NOTHING STAYS・ IN FIFTY YEARS OR SO, IT&rsquo;S GONNA CHANGE YOU KNOW. BUT OH IT&rsquo;S HEAVEN NOWADAYS! AND THAT&rsquo;S GOOD, ISN&rsquo;T IT? GRAND, ISN&rsquo;T IT? GREAT, ISN&rsquo;T IT? SWELL, ISN&rsquo;T IT? FUN, ISN&rsquo;T IT? BUT NOTHING STAYS・ IN FIFTY YEARS OR SO, IT&rsquo;S GONNA CHANGE YOU KNOW. BUT OH IT&rsquo;S HEAVEN NOWADAYS!"
