ESFP,"Come on Fred, say it again! Guess it&rsquo;s about time I met your friend down at the club, huh? Fred? When am I gonna meet your friend down at the club?"
ESFP, I been working on my act! Everytime I get an idea I write it down in my diary・ But you got connection・that guy down at the club・ But that night ・you said・ You lied to me! Nobody walks out on me.
ESFP,"SOMETIMES I&rsquo;M RIGHT, SOMETIMES I&rsquo;M WRONG, BUT HE DOESN&rsquo;T CARE, HE STRINGS ALONG. HE LOVES ME SO, THAT FUNNY HONEY OF MINE! SOMETIMES I&rsquo;M DOWN, SOMETIMES I&rsquo;M UP, BUT HE FOLLOWS ROUND LIKE SOME DROOPY EYED PUP. HE LOVES ME SO, THAT FUNNY HONEY OF MINE. HE AIN&rsquo;T NO SHEIK, THAT&rsquo;S NO GREAT PHYSIQUE, AND LORD KNOWS HE AIN&rsquo;T GOT THE SMARTS. BUT LOOK AT THAT SOUL I TELL YOU THAT WHOLE IS A WHOLE LOT GREATER THAN THE SUM OF HIS PARTS! AND IF YOU KNEW HIM LIKE ME, I KNOW YOU&rsquo;D AGREE・ WHAT IF THE WORLD SLANDERED MY NAME? WHY HE&rsquo;D BE RIGHT THERE, TAKING THE BLAME. HE LOVES ME SO AND IT ALL SUITS ME FINE. THAT FUNNY, SUNNY, HONEY, HUBBY OF MINE!"
ESFP,"You double crosser! You big blabber mouth! You said you&rsquo;d stick! How could you do this to me, your own wife! You are a disloyal husband!  Yeah I shot him. He was tryin&rsquo; to walk out on me, the louse."
ESFP,Hang me? Amos did you hear what he said? Hail Mary full of grace・
ESFP,THE Velma Kelly?! Gosh I am sure pleased to meet you! I read about you in the papers・I was at the club that night・!
ESFP,"Miss Kelly, can I ask you something? The Assistant District Attorney Mr. Harrison said what I done is a hanging case and he&rsquo;s prepared to ask for the maximum penalty."
ESFP,I&rsquo;m scared. I sure would appreciate some advice・ I guess・I guess I&rsquo;ll just tell them the truth?
ESFP,Well what&rsquo;s your grounds then・? I ain&rsquo;t got a lawyer
ESFP,"Oh Amos I knew you&rsquo;d come. Amos, I know I&rsquo;ve been sinful. But I&rsquo;m changin&rsquo; my ways. All I want now is to make it up to you. For what I done. And I will Amos, i will, just as soon as I get outta here. And you can help me get outta here. See there&rsquo;s this lawyer, and he costs five thousand dollars."
ESFP,"Oh Amos I know I lied, and I know, I cheated, Oh Amos, I even stole money from your pants pockets whiles you was sleepin&rsquo;・"
ESFP,"Oh Amos I know I lied, and I know, I cheated, Oh Amos, I even stole money from your pants pockets whiles you was sleepin&rsquo;・"
ESFP,I&rsquo;m so flattered y&rsquo;all came to talk to lil&rsquo;ole me. Guess you wanna know why i shot the bum.
ESFP,"You wanna know something? I always wanted my name in the papers. All my life, I always wanted my very own act. But no, no・they always turned me down. It was one big world full of NO. Then along came Amos; sweet, safe Amos, who never says no."
ESFP,"Ya gotta love a guy like that. I gave up on the vaudeville idea cause I thought opportunity had passed me by・but oh no, it ain&rsquo;t. If this Flynn guy gets me free and with all this publicity, I could still get into vaudeville. I could have me a world full of YES."
ESFP,THE NAME ON EVERYBODY&rsquo;S LIPS IS GONNA BE - ROXIE. THE LADY RAKIN&rsquo; IN THE CHIPS IS GONNA BE - ROXIE. I&rsquo;M GONNA BE A CELEBRITY AND THAT MEANS SOMEONE THAT EVERYONE KNOWS.
ESFP,"THEY&rsquo;RE GONNA RECOGNIZE MY EYES, MY HAIR, MY TEETH, MY SMILE, MY NOSE! FROM JUST SOME DUMB MECHANIC&rsquo;S WIFE I&rsquo;M GONNA BE - ROXIE. WHO SAYS THAT MURDER&rsquo;S NOT AN ART? AND WHO IN CASE SHE DOESN&rsquo;T HANG, CAN SAY SHE STARTED WITH A BANG? ROXIE HART!"
ESFP,"I&rsquo;m gonna have a real swell act too! Yeah. I&rsquo;ll get a boy to work with・ Someone who can dip me and smile at me・oh heck! Think big Roxie, more boys! It&rsquo;ll frame me better."
ESFP,THINK OF THOSE AUTOGRAPHS I&rsquo;LL SIGN &ldquo;GOOD LUCK TO YOU&rdquo; ROXIE AND I&rsquo;LL APPEAR IN A LAVALIERE THAT GOES ALL THE WAY DOWN TO MY WAIST
ESFP,"Oooohhh I&rsquo;m a star. And I love the audience for loving me. And that&rsquo;s because none of us got enough love in our childhood. And that&rsquo;s show biz, kid. TO SEE HER NAME BILLED DOWN BELOW!"
ESFP,Listen it&rsquo;s me they want now・I&rsquo;m a big star. Singular. Nothing personal - you understand.
ESFP,"Oh please, please don&rsquo;t worry about me. I just hope the fall didn&rsquo;t hurt・ the baby."
ESFP,I&rsquo;m sick of yous telling me what to do! I&rsquo;m a big star and you treat me like some dumb common criminal!
ESFP,Better than a crooked lawyer! Who&rsquo;s out for all he can steal! Maybe I could・they love me!
ESFP,I been up all night rehearsing. Oh Billy I&rsquo;m scared・
ESFP,I&rsquo;m afraid that&rsquo;s true. When I permitted him to drive me home one rainy night. I don&rsquo;t think I woulda gone with him if me and Mr. Hart hadn&rsquo;t quarrelled that very morning.
ESFP,"I told him I don&rsquo;t like working in that cheap south side speakeasy, and I don&rsquo;t like him working such long hours at the garage; I want you home with me! I says・ I want to・darn your socks and iron your shirts. because I want a real home・and a baby."
ESFP,"I wanted to! I tried! But Mr. Casely would plead with me and say,"
ESFP,"I was on my way home from work about 2am and stopped at an all night grocer for baking powder, to make cupcakes for my Amos. I took my bath and was getting ready for bed when the doorbell rang・I thought it might be a friend in need, so I slipped on my kimona and went to the door"
ESFP,Wait! I&rsquo;m Roxie Hart! Don&rsquo;t you want my picture! Hey wait just a minute! What the hell happened? Where are all the reporters? Photographers? The publicity・?
ESFP,"IT&rsquo;S GOOD, ISN&rsquo;T IT? GRAND, ISN&rsquo;T IT? GREAT, ISN&rsquo;T IT? SWELL, ISN&rsquo;T IT? SWELL, ISN&rsquo;T IT? FUN, ISN&rsquo;T IT? NOWADAYS. THERE&rsquo;S MEN EVERYWHERE, JAZZ EVERYWHERE, BOOZE EVERYWHERE, LIFE EVERYWHERE・JOY EVERYWHERE・ NOWADAYS. YOU CAN LIKE THE LIFE YOU&rsquo;RE LIVING - YOU CAN LIVE THE LIFE YOU LIKE. YOU CAN EVEN MARRY HARRY, BUT MESS AROUND WITH IKE. AND THAT&rsquo;S GOOD, ISN&rsquo;T IT? GRAND, ISN&rsquo;T IT? GREAT, ISN&rsquo;T IT? SWELL."
ESFP,"Believe us, we could not have done it without you. But we are living examples of what is possible!"
ESFP,"YOU CAN LIKE THE LIFE YOU&rsquo;RE LIVING - YOU CAN LIVE THE LIFE YOU LIKE. YOU CAN EVEN MARRY HARRY BUT MESS AROUND WITH IKE. AND THAT&rsquo;S GOOD, ISN&rsquo;T IT? GRAND, ISN&rsquo;T IT? GREAT, ISN&rsquo;T IT? SWELL, ISN&rsquo;T IT? SWELL, ISN&rsquo;T IT? FUN, ISN&rsquo;T IT? BUT NOTHING STAYS・ IN FIFTY YEARS OR SO, IT&rsquo;S GONNA CHANGE YOU KNOW. BUT OH IT&rsquo;S HEAVEN NOWADAYS!
