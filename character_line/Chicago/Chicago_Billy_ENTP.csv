ENTP,"Is everybody here? Is everybody ready? I DON&rsquo;T CARE ABOUT EXPENSIVE THINGS, CASHMERE COATS, DIAMOND RINGS, DON&rsquo;T MEAN A THING, ALL I CARE ABOUT IS LOVE! I DON&rsquo;T CARE FOR WEARING SILK CRAVATS, RUBY STUDS, SATIN SPATS, DON&rsquo;T MEAN A THING - ALL I CARE ABOUT IS LOVE!"
ENTP,"LET ME SEE HER STANDIN&rsquo; THERE, HONEST MISTER I&rsquo;M A MILLIONAIRE! I DON&rsquo;T CARE FOR ANY FINE ATTIRE, VANDERBILT MAY ADMIRE, NO NO NOT ME, ALL I CARE ABOUT IS LOVE."
ENTP,"SHOW ME LONG LOVELY HAIR, FLOWING DOWN, ABOUT TO THERE, AND WHEN I SEE HER RUNNIN&rsquo; FREE, KEEP YOUR MONEY THAT&rsquo;S ENOUGH FOR ME!"
ENTP,"I spoke to him myself. He said that his daughter went to hell years ago and could stay there. Very touching, isn&rsquo;t it? But I&rsquo;ve got a motto. And that motto is &ldquo;play square&rdquo;. When you came to me I didn&rsquo;t ask you if she was guilty."
ENTP,"I didn&rsquo;t ask if she&rsquo;s a dope fiend, or a drunk・All I said was &ldquo;have you got 5 thousand dollars?&rdquo; and you said yes. But you haven&rsquo;t. So I figure you&rsquo;re a dirty liar."
ENTP,"But I took her case and I&rsquo;ll keep it cause I play square. Now here&rsquo;s what we&rsquo;re gonna do・by tomorrow morning I&rsquo;ll have your wife&rsquo;s name splashed across every newspaper in town as the hottest little jazz slayer since Velma Kelly. Then we announce we&rsquo;re gonna hold an auction. To raise money for her defense. They&rsquo;ll buy anything she ever touched - shoes, dresses - plus we tell&rsquo;em that if she gets hanged・"
ENTP,"The stuff triples in value. And that&rsquo;s how we raise the rest of the five grand. It&rsquo;s like this, either I get the five thousand・"
ENTP,"And another thing, pipe down on the swearin&rsquo;. From here on in you say nothing rougher than &ldquo;Oh dear&rdquo;. Get it?"
ENTP,"And another thing, pipe down on the swearin&rsquo;. From here on in you say nothing rougher than &ldquo;Oh dear&rdquo;. Get it?"
ENTP,"Everyone please, my client will be happy to answer all of your questions・ Ow! Will you stop biting! I&rsquo;ll get.. hydrophobia."
ENTP,Oh hi Trixie. What a hellion huh? And a major socialite too! Her father owns all of the pineapples in Hawaii!
ENTP,I want the best doctor in the city for my poor poor client!  I can assure you all - Roxie will come to trial at the earliest possible moment!
ENTP,"Oh Andy, I didn&rsquo;t see you there. Sit down. Look Andy, I&rsquo;m afraid I gotta hit you hard. I can only hope you&rsquo;ll be big about it."
ENTP,"Right, it&rsquo;s the kid&rsquo;s name I&rsquo;m thinking of. You know when she&rsquo;s due? September. But I want you to pass around those cigars anyway. Don&rsquo;t give a damn when people・"
ENTP,"When people laugh. Because they can count. Can you count? At her arrest, you said you and Roxie hadn&rsquo;t consummated for 4 months prior to the incident."
ENTP,"Well just forget about that・Roxie needs your support. I mean, what are you gonna do・ Divorce her?"
ENTP,"I&rsquo;ve been waitin&rsquo;, don&rsquo;t keep me waitin&rsquo;. I got Amos to file for divorce. Now, I can get him on the stand and get him to admit that he made a terrible mistake, because he still loves you. And of course, you still love him. And the jury can fall all over themselves to play cupid and get you two back together."
ENTP,You ARE some dumb common criminal. Who happens to be saving your bacon!
ENTP,"Maybe you could appear in court without me then, huh? Wise up kid. They&rsquo;d love you even more if you were hanged. Sells more papers"
ENTP,"I quit! You&rsquo;re a phony, a flash in the pan. In a coupla weeks nobody&rsquo;ll even know who you are. That&rsquo;s Chicago."
ENTP,"No? &ldquo;Please Billy&rdquo; you said, &ldquo;Come back - I need you&rdquo; you said. Right after they hanged Katalin. Remember now? So shut up about the dress. You&rsquo;re gonna do like we planned?"
ENTP,"You got nothing to worry about. It&rsquo;s all a circus kid, Kid. A three ring circus."
ENTP,"GIVE&rsquo;EM AN ACT WITH LOTS OF FLASH IN IT, AND THE REACTION WILL BE PASSIONATE. GIVE&rsquo;EM THE OLD HOCUS POCUS. BEAD AND FEATHER&rsquo;EM. HOW CAN THEY SEE WITH SEQUINS IN THEIR EYES? WHAT IF YOUR HINGES ALL ARE RUSTING? WHAT IF IN FACT YOU&rsquo;RE JUST DISGUSTING? RAZZLE DAZZLE &lsquo;EM AND THEY&rsquo;LL NEVER CATCH WISE! GIVE &lsquo;EM THE OLD RAZZLE DAZZLE"
ENTP,"ROW AFTER ROW WILL GROW VOCIFEROUS. HOW CAN THEY HEAR THE TRUTH ABOVE THE ROAR? WHEN YOU&rsquo;RE IN TROUBLE GO INTO YOUR DANCE! THOUGH YOU ARE STIFFER THAN A GIRDER, THEY LET YA GET AWAY"
ENTP,"Are you at present obtaining a divorce from the defendant? And by that, you mean you doubt the paternity of the child. Did you even bother to ask her, the mother to be?"
ENTP,"Just jumped to a conclusion? What if Roxie Hart swore that you were the father of her child, which she does・"
ENTP,"Roxie, I have here a statement in which you admit to having an illicit affair with the deceased, Fred Casely. True or false? And when did that begin?"
ENTP,Roxie Hart the State has accused you of the murder of Fred Casely. Are you guilty or not guilty!
ENTP,"Ladies and Gentlemen of the Jury, you and I have never killed. We can&rsquo;t know the agony, the hell that Roxie Hart has lived through. This drunken beast forced his way into her home and threatened not one but two lives. She shot him. We don&rsquo;t deny that. She has prayed for forgiveness, though nothing can bring Casely back. My god, hasn&rsquo;t she been punished enough? We can&rsquo;t give her happiness, but we can give her a second chance. The defence rests!"
ENTP,"You were found NOT guilty, that&rsquo;s what happened. Your gratitude is overwhelming. But forget it; I&rsquo;m only in it for the money anyway. You&rsquo;re a free woman, Roxie Hart. And God save Illinois. My exit music please!"
