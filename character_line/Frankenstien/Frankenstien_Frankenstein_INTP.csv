INTP,Certainly; it would indeed be very impertinent and inhuman of me to trouble you with any inquisitiveness of mine.
INTP,"It gives me the greatest delight to see you; but tell me how you left my father, brothers, and Elizabeth. You have guessed right; I have lately been so deeply engaged in one occupation that I have not allowed myself sufficient rest, as you see; but I hope, I sincerely hope, that all these employments are now at an end and that I am at length free."
INTP,"Do not ask me, he* can tell. Oh, save me! Save me! Dearest Clerval, how kind, how very good you are to me. This whole winter, instead of being spent in study, as you promised yourself, has been consumed in my sick room. How shall I ever repay you? I feel the greatest remorse for the disappointment of which I have been the occasion, but you will forgive me."
INTP,"Is that all, my dear Henry? How could you suppose that my first thought would not fly towards those dear, dear friends whom I love and who are so deserving of my love?"
INTP,"Dear, dear Elizabeth! I will write instantly and relieve them from the anxiety they must feel."
INTP,"To go instantly to Geneva: come with me, Henry, to order the horses. William, dear angel! this is thy funeral, this thy dirge!"
INTP,"The murderer discovered! Good God! how can that be? who could attempt to pursue him? It is impossible; one might as well try to overtake the winds, or confine a mountain-stream with a straw. I saw him too; he was free last night! Justine Moritz! Poor, poor girl, is she the accused?"
INTP,"But it is wrongfully; every one knows that; no one believes it, surely, Ernest? You are all mistaken; I know the murderer. Justine, poor, good Justine, is innocent. My dear father, you are mistaken; Justine is innocent. She is innocent, my Elizabeth, and that shall be proved; fear nothing, but let your spirits be cheered by the assurance of her acquittal."
INTP,"My cousin, it is decided as you may have expected; all judges had rather that ten innocent should suffer than that one guilty should escape. But she has confessed."
INTP,"Wandering spirits, if indeed ye wander, and do not rest in your narrow beds, allow me this faint happiness, or take me, as your companion, away from the joys of life."
INTP,"Devil, do you dare approach me? And do not you fear the fierce vengeance of my arm wreaked on your miserable head? Begone, vile insect! Or rather, stay, that I may trample you to dust! And, oh! That I could, with the extinction of your miserable existence, restore those victims whom you have so diabolically murdered!"
INTP,"Abhorred monster! Fiend that thou art! The tortures of hell are too mild a vengeance for thy crimes. Wretched devil! You reproach me with your creation, come on, then, that I may extinguish the spark which I so negligently bestowed."
INTP,"Begone! I will not hear you. There can be no community between you and me; we are enemies. Begone, or let us try our strength in a fight, in which one must fall."
INTP,"Why do you call to my remembrance,&rsquo; I rejoined, &lsquo;circumstances of which I shudder to reflect, that I have been the miserable origin and author? Cursed be the day, abhorred devil, in which you first saw light! Cursed (although I curse myself) be the hands that formed you!"
INTP,You have made me wretched beyond expression. You have left me no power to consider whether I am just to you or not. Begone! Relieve me from the sight of your detested form.
INTP,"I do refuse it, and no torture shall ever extort a consent from me. You may render me the most miserable of men, but you shall never make me base in my own eyes."
INTP,"Shall I create another like yourself, whose joint wickedness might desolate the world. Begone! I have answered you; you may torture me, but I will never consent."
INTP,"You propose, to fly from the habitations of man, to dwell in those wilds where the beasts of the field will be your only companions."
INTP,"How can you, who long for the love and sympathy of man, persevere in this exile? You will return and again seek their kindness, and you will meet with their detestation; your evil passions will be renewed, and you will then have a companion to aid you in the task of destruction. This may not be; cease to argue the point, for I cannot consent."
INTP,"You swear, to be harmless; but have you not already shown a degree of malice that should reasonably make me distrust you? May not even this be a feint that will increase your triumph by affording a wider scope for your revenge?"
INTP,"I consent to your demand, on your solemn oath to quit Europe forever, and every other place in the neighbourhood of man, as soon as I shall deliver into your hands a female who will accompany you in your exile."
INTP,"Oh! Stars and clouds and winds, ye are all about to mock me; if ye really pity me, crush sensation and memory; let me become as nought; but if not, depart, depart, and leave me in darkness"
INTP,"My dear father, reassure yourself. I love my cousin tenderly and sincerely. I never saw any woman who excited, as Elizabeth does, my warmest admiration and affection. My future hopes and prospects are entirely bound up in the expectation of our union."
