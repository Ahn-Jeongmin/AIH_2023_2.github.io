INFP,"I don't think I will send it anywhere, No: I won't send it anywhere."
INFP,"I know you will laugh at me, but I really can't exhibit it. I have put too much of myself into it."
INFP,"You don't understand me, Harry. Of course I am not like him. I know that perfectly well. Indeed, I should be sorry to look like him. You shrug your shoulders? I am telling you the truth. There is a fatality about all physical and intellectual distinction, the sort of fatality that seems to dog through history the faltering steps of kings."
ENFP,"That is very true, and I could easily forgive his pride, if he had not mortified mine."
ENFP,"But she does help him on, as much as her nature will allow. If I can perceive her regard for him, he must be a simpleton, indeed, not to discover it too."
ENFP,"But if a woman is partial to a man, and does not endeavour to conceal it, he must find it out."
ENFP,"Your plan is a good one, where nothing is in question but the desire of being well married, and if I were determined to get a rich husband, or any husband, I dare say I should adopt it. But these are not Jane&rsquo;s feelings; she is not acting by design. As yet, she cannot even be certain of the degree of her own regard nor of its reasonableness."
ENFP,"She has known him only a fortnight. She danced four dances with him at Meryton; she saw him one morning at his own house, and has since dined with him in company four times. This is not quite enough to make her understand his character."
ENFP,"Yes; these four evenings have enabled them to ascertain that they both like Vingt-un better than Commerce; but with respect to any other leading characteristic, I do not imagine that much has been unfolded"
ENFP,"You make melaugh, Charlotte; but it is not sound. You know it is not sound, and that you would never act in this way yourself."
ENFP,That is a question which Mr. Darcy only can answer.
ENFP,"That would be a good scheme, if you were sure that they would not offer to send her home. But if you have got them to-day, my mother&rsquo;s purpose will be answered."
ENFP,"I deserve neither such praise nor such censure, I am not a great reader, and I have pleasure in many things. And I wish my collection were larger for your benefit and my own credit; but I am an idle fellow, and though I have not many, I have more than I ever looked into."
ENFP,"Then, you must comprehend a great deal in your idea of an accomplished woman."
ENFP,"That is exactly what I should have supposed of you, Oh! yes?I understand you perfectly."
ENFP,"Indeed, Mamma, you are mistaken. You quite mistook Mr. Darcy. He only meant that there was not such a variety of people to be met with in the country as in the town, which you must acknowledge to be true."
ENFP,"And so ended his affection. There has been many a one, I fancy, overcome in the same way. I wonder who first discovered the efficacy of poetry in driving away love!"
ENFP,"Of a fine, stout, healthy love it may. Everything nourishes what is strong already. But if it be only a slight, thin sort of inclination, I am convinced that one good sonnet will starve it entirely away."
ENFP,"Your humility, Mr. Bingley, must disarm reproof. And which of the two do you call my little recent piece of modesty?"
