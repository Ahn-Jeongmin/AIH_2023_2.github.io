ISFJ,"Santiago, I could go with you again. We&rsquo;ve made some money."
ISFJ,But remember how you went eighty-seven days without fish and then we caught big ones every day for three weeks.
ISFJ,It was papa made me leave. I am a boy and I must obey him. He hasn&rsquo;t much faith.
ISFJ,Can I offer you a beer on the Terrace and then we&rsquo;ll take the stuff home.
ISFJ,Can I go out to get sardines for you for tomorrow? I would like to go. If I cannot fish with you. I would like to serve in some way.
ISFJ,How old was I when you first took me in a boat?
ISFJ,I can remember the tail slapping and banging and the thwart breaking and the noise of the clubbing. I can remember you throwing me into the bow where the wet coiled lines were and feeling the whole boat shiver and the noise of you clubbing him like chopping a tree down and the sweet blood smell all over me.
ISFJ,I remember everything from when we first went together.
ISFJ,May I get the sardines? I know where I can get four baits too. Let me get four fresh ones.
ISFJ,"Where are you going? I&rsquo;ll try to get him to work far out, then if you hook something truly big we can come to your aid."
ISFJ,But I will see something that he cannot see such as a bird working and get him to come out after dolphin. He is almost blind.
ISFJ,"Let us take the stuff home, So I can get the cast net and go after the sardines."
ISFJ,No. I will eat at home. Do you want me to make the fire? May I take the cast net?
ISFJ,"That&rsquo;s easy. I can always borrow two dollars and a half. Keep warm old man, remember we are in September. Keep the blanket around you,. You&rsquo;ll not fish without eating while I&rsquo;m alive."
ISFJ,"I thanked him already, You don&rsquo;t need to thank him."
ISFJ,"I&rsquo;ve been asking you to, I have not wished to open the container until you were ready."
ISFJ,There was nothing ever like them. He hits the longest ball I have ever seen.
ISFJ,I wanted to take him fishing but I was too timid to ask him. Then I asked you to ask him and you were too timid
ISFJ,"He was a great manager, My father thinks he was the greatest."
ISFJ,Que Va. There are many good fishermen and some great ones. But there is only you.
ISFJ,I don&rsquo;t know. All I know is that young boys sleep late and hard. I do not like for him to waken me. It is as though I were inferior.
ISFJ,Do you want coffee? How did you sleep old man? Now I must get your sardines and mine and your fresh baits. He brings our gear himself. He never wants anyone to carry anything.
ISFJ,We must get a good killing lance and always have it on board. You can make the blade from a spring leaf from an old Ford. We can grind it in Guanabacoa. It should be sharp and not tempered so it will break. My knife broke.
ISFJ,"I will have everything in order, You get your hands well old man"
ISFJ,"Lie down, old man, and I will bring you your clean shirt. And something to eat."
ISFJ,"I&rsquo;ll bring the food and the papers, Rest well, old man. I will bring stuff from the drugstore for your hands."
