ISFP,"No, You&rsquo;re with a lucky boat. Stay with them"
ISFP,"I remember, I know you did not leave me because you doubted."
ISFP,"No. Go and play baseball. I can still row and Rogelio will throw the net. You bought me a beer, You are already a man."
ISFP,Five and you nearly were killed when I brought the fish in too green and he nearly tore the boat to pieces. Can you remember?
ISFP,Can you really remember that or did I just tell it to you? If you were my boy I&rsquo;d take you out and gamble. But you are your father&rsquo;s and your mother&rsquo;s and you are in a lucky boat.
ISFP,I have mine left from today. I put them in salt in the box. Tomorrow is going to be a good day with this current.
ISFP,Far out to come in when the wind shifts. I want to be out before it is light. He does not like to work too far out.
ISFP,A pot of yellow rice with fish. Do you want some? No. I will make it later on. Or I may eat the rice cold
ISFP,&ldquo;How would you like to see me bring one in that dressed out over a thousand pounds?
ISFP,Do you think we should buy a terminal of the lottery with an eighty-five? Tomorrow is the eighty-fifth day.
ISFP,I think perhaps I can too. But I try not to borrow. First you borrow. Then you beg.
ISFP,"The month when the great fish come, anyone can be a fisherman in May."
ISFP,"Then live a long time and take care of yourself, What are we eating?"
ISFP,Who gave this to you? I must thank him. I&rsquo;ll give him the belly meat of a big fish. Has he done this for us more than once? I must give him something more than the belly meat then. He is very thoughtful for us.
ISFP,"I like the beer in cans best. That&rsquo;s very kind of you, Should we eat? Your stew is excellent,"
ISFP,In the American League it is the Yankees as I said. That means nothing. The great DiMaggio is himself again.
ISFP,"Naturally. But he makes the difference. In the other league, between Brooklyn and Philadelphia I must take Brooklyn. But then I think of Dick Sisler and those great drives In the old park. Do you remember when he used to come to the Terrace?"
ISFP,I know. It was a great mistake. He might have gone with us. Then we would have that for all of our lives.
ISFP,"They say his father was a fisherman. Maybe he was as poor as we are and would understand. The great Sisler&rsquo;s father was never poor and he, the father, was playing in the Big Leagues when he was my age. When I was your age I was before the mast on a square rigged ship that ran to Africa and I have seen lions on the beaches in the evening."
ISFP,He used to come to the Terrace sometimes too in the older days. But he was rough and harsh-spoken and difficult when he was drinking. His mind was on horses as well as baseball. At least he carried lists of horses at all times in his pocket and frequently spoke the names of horses on the telephone.
ISFP,"Because he came here the most times, If Durocher had continued to come here each year your father would think him the greatest manager"
ISFP,Thank you. You make me happy. I hope no fish will come along so great that he will prove us wrong.
ISFP,"I may not be as strong as I think, But I know many tricks and I have resolution. You ought to go to bed now so that you will be fresh in the morning. I will take the things back to the Terrace."
ISFP,Age is my alarm clock. Why do old men wake so early? Is it to have one longer day?
ISFP,We&rsquo;ll put the gear in the boat and then get some.
ISFP,"Very well, Manolin, I feel confident today."
ISFP,"We&rsquo;re different, I let you carry things when you were five years old."
ISFP,"Albacore, He&rsquo;ll make a beautiful bait. He&rsquo;ll weigh ten pounds. If the others heard me talking out loud they would think that I am crazy, But since I am not crazy, I do not care. And the rich have radios to talk to them in their boats and to bring them the baseball."
ISFP,"Come on, Make another turn. Just smell them. Aren&rsquo;t they lovely? Eat them good now and then there is the tuna. Hard and cold and lovely. Don&rsquo;t be shy, fish. Eat them"
ISFP,"He&rsquo;ll take it. God help him to take it. He can&rsquo;t have gone, Christ knows he can&rsquo;t have gone. He&rsquo;s making a turn. Maybe he has been hooked before and he remembers something of it."
ISFP,I wish I had the boy. I&rsquo;m being towed by a fish and I&rsquo;m the towing bitt. I could make the line fast. But then he could break it. I must hold him all I can and give him line when he must have it. Thank God he is travelling and not going down.
ISFP,I wish I had the boy. To help me and to see this. They are good. They play and make jokes and love one another. They are our brothers like the flying fish.
ISFP,"Fish, I&rsquo;ll stay with you until I am dead."
ISFP,"He&rsquo;s headed north, God let him jump, I have enough line to handle him."
ISFP,"Fish, I love you and respect you very much. But I will kill you dead before this day ends."
ISFP,"How old are you, bird. Is this your first trip? It&rsquo;s steady, It&rsquo;s too steady. You shouldn&rsquo;t be that tired after a windless night. What are birds coming to? Take a good rest, small bird, Then go in and take your chance like any man or bird or fish."
ISFP,"Stay at my house if you like, bird, I am sorry I cannot hoist the sail and take you in with the small breeze that is rising. But I am with a friend."
ISFP,"Now, I must eat the small tuna. I can reach him with the gaff and eat him here in comfort."
ISFP,"I don&rsquo;t think I can eat an entire one. What kind of a hand is that, Cramp then if you want. Make yourself into a claw. It will do you no good."
ISFP,"How do you feel, hand? I&rsquo;ll eat some more for you. How does it go, hand? Or is it too early to know?"
ISFP,"It is a strong full-blooded fish, I was lucky to get him instead of dolphin. Dolphin is too sweet. This is hardly sweet at all and all the strength is still in it"
ISFP,"Be patient, hand, I do this for you. You can let the cord go, hand, and I will handle him with the right arm alone until you [59] stop that nonsense."
ISFP,God help me to have the cramp go. Because I do not know what the fish is going to do.
ISFP,"Light brisa, Better weather for me than for you, fish."
ISFP,"I am not religious. But I will say ten Our Fathers and ten Hail Marys that I should catch this fish, and I promise to make a pilgrimage to the Virgin of Cobre if I catch him. That is a promise."
ISFP,"Hail Mary full of Grace the Lord is with thee. Blessed art thou among women and blessed is the fruit of thy womb, Jesus. Holy Mary, Mother of God, pray for us sinners now and at the hour of our death. Amen. Blessed Virgin, pray for the death of this fish. Wonderful though he is."
ISFP,"I had better re-bait that little line out over the stern. If the fish decides to stay another night I will need to eat again and the water is low in the bottle. I don&rsquo;t think I can get anything but a dolphin here. But if I eat him fresh enough he won&rsquo;t be bad. I wish a flying fish would come on board tonight. But I have no light to attract them. A flying fish is excellent to eat raw and I would not have to cut him up. I must save all my strength now. Christ, I did not know he was so big."
ISFP,"I&rsquo;ll kill him though, in all his greatness and his glory."
ISFP,I told the boy I was a strange old man. Now is when I must prove it.
ISFP,"He hasn&rsquo;t changed at all, I&rsquo;ll lash the two oars together across the stern and that will slow him in the night,. He&rsquo;s good for the night and so am I."
ISFP,"How do you feel, fish? I feel good and my left hand is better and I have food for a night and a day. Pull the boat, fish."
ISFP,"The fish is my friend too, I have never seen or heard of such a fish. But I must kill him. I am glad we do not have to try to kill the stars."
ISFP,"He is tiring or he is resting, Now let me get through the eating of this dolphin and get some rest and a little sleep."
ISFP,What an excellent fish dolphin is to eat cooked. And what a miserable fish raw. I will never go in a boat again without salt or limes.
ISFP,"There will be bad weather in three or four days, But not tonight and not tomorrow. Rig now to get some sleep, old man, while the fish is calm and steady."
ISFP,"You better be fearless and confident yourself, old man. You&rsquo;re holding him again but you cannot get line. But soon he has to circle."
ISFP,"You did not do so badly for something worthless, But there was a moment when I could not find you."
ISFP,"I could not fail myself and die on a fish like this. Now that I have him coming so beautifully, God help me endure. I&rsquo;ll say a hundred Our Fathers and a hundred Hail Marys. But I cannot say them now."
ISFP,"I have no cramps. He&rsquo;ll be up soon and I can last. You have to last. Don&rsquo;t even speak of it. I&rsquo;ll rest on the next turn as he goes out, I feel much better. Then in two or three turns more I will have him."
ISFP,"I&rsquo;ll just steer south and west, A man is never lost at sea and it is a long island."
ISFP,"Fish, Fish, you are going to have to die anyway. Do you have to kill me too?"
ISFP,"Keep my head dear, I am a tired old man. But I have killed this fish which is my brother and now I must do the slave work. Get to work, old man, There is very much slave work to be done now that the fight is over."
ISFP,"I need a pencil for that, My head is not that clear. But I think the great DiMaggio would be proud of me today. I had no bone spurs. But the hands and the back hurt truly."
ISFP,"But man is not made for defeat. A man can be destroyed but not defeated. Don&rsquo;t think, old man. Sail on this course and take it when it comes.  Think about something cheerful, old man. Every minute now you are closer to home. You sail lighter for the loss of forty pounds."
ISFP,"You think too much, old man. I killed him in self-defense, and I killed him well."
ISFP,"Go on, galano. Slide down a mile deep. Go see your friend, or maybe it&rsquo;s your mother."
ISFP,"They must have taken a quarter of him and of the best meat,I wish it were a dream and that I had never hooked him. I&rsquo;m sorry about it, fish. It makes everything wrong."
ISFP,"I shouldn&rsquo;t have gone out so far, fish, Neither for you nor for me. I&rsquo;m sorry, fish.I wish I had a stone for the knife, I should have brought a stone."
ISFP,"I have the gaff now, But it will do no good. I have the two oars and the tiller and the short club. You&rsquo;re tired, old man, You&rsquo;re tired inside."
ISFP,"It will be dark soon, Then I should see the glow of Havana.. If I am too far to the eastward I will see the lights of one of the new beaches."
ISFP,"Half fish. Fish that you were. I am sorry that I went too far out. I ruined us both. But we have killed many sharks, you and I, and ruined many others. How many did you ever kill, old fish? You do not have that spear on your head for nothing."
ISFP,"You might, You tried to buy it with eighty-four days at sea. They nearly sold it to you too."
ISFP,"Eat that, galanos. And make a dream you&rsquo;ve killed a man. Nothing, I went out too far."
ISFP,I know how to care for them. In the night I spat something strange and felt something in my chest was broken.
ISFP,"Bring any of the papers of the time that I was gone, You must get well fast for there is much that I can learn and you can teach me everything"
