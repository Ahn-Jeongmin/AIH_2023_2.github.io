INTJ,"I certainly shall not. You know how I detest it, unless I am particularly acquainted with my partner. At such an assembly as this it would be insupportable. Your sisters are engaged, and there is not another woman in the room whom it would not be a punishment to me to stand up with. You are dancing with the only handsome girl in the room"
INTJ,"Which do you mean? She is tolerable, but not handsome enough to tempt me; I am in no humour at present to give consequence to young ladies who are slighted by other men. You had better return to your partner and enjoy her smiles, for you are wasting your time with me."
INTJ,With great energy; but it is always a subject which makes a lady energetic.
INTJ,"Certainly, sir; and it has the advantage also of being in vogue amongst the less polished societies of the world. Every savage can dance."
INTJ,"You saw me dance at Meryton, I believe, sir. It is a compliment which I never pay to any place if I can avoid it."
INTJ,I had once had some thought of fixing in town myself?for I am fond of superior society; but I did not feel quite certain that the air of London would agree with Lady Lucas.
INTJ,"You conjecture is totally wrong, I assure you. My mind was more agreeably engaged. I have been meditating on the very great pleasure which a pair of fine eyes in the face of a pretty woman can bestow. Miss Elizabeth Bennet."
INTJ,"That is exactly the question which I expected you to ask. A lady&rsquo;s imagination is very rapid; it jumps from admiration to love, from love to matrimony, in a moment. I knew you would be wishing me joy."
INTJ,"Not at all, they were brightened by the exercise. I think I have heard you say that their uncle is an attorney on Meryton. But it must very materially lessen their chance of marrying men of any consideration in the world."
INTJ,"It ought to be good, it has been the work of many generations. I cannot comprehend the neglect of a family library in such days as these"
INTJ,"Your list of the common extent of accomplishments, has too much truth. The word is applied to many a woman who de serves it no otherwise than by netting a purse or covering a screen."
INTJ,"But I am very far from agreeing with you in your estimation of ladies in general. I cannot boast of knowing more than half-a-dozen, in the whole range of my acquaintance, that are really accomplished"
INTJ,"All this she must possess, and to all this she must yet add something more substantial, in the improvement of her mind by extensive reading."
INTJ,"Undoubtedly, there is a meanness in all the arts which ladies sometimes condescend to employ for captivation. Whatever bears affinity to cunning is despicable."
INTJ,"The country, can in general supply but a few sub jects for such a study. In a country neighbourhood you move in a very confined and unvarying society."
INTJ,I have been used consider poetry as the food of love.
INTJ,They are generally long; but whether always charming it is not for me to determine. My style of writing is very different from yours.
INTJ,"Nothing is more deceitful, than the appearance of humility. It is often only carelessness of opinion, and sometimes an indirect boast."
INTJ,"The indirect boast; for you are really proud of your defects in writing, because you consider them as proceeding from a rapidity of thought and carelessness of execution, which, if not estimable, you think at least highly interesting. The power of doing anything with quickness is always prized much by the possessor, and often without any attention to the imperfection of the performance."
INTJ,"When you told Mrs. Bennet this morning that if you ever resolved upon quitting Netherfield you should be gone in five minutes, you meant it to be a sort of panegyric, of compliment to yourself?and yet what is there so very laudable in a precipitance which must leave very necessary business undone, and can be of no real advantage to yourself or anyone else?"
INTJ,"&ldquo;I dare say you believed it; but I am by no means convinced that you would be gone with such celerity. Your conduct would be quite as 33 dependent on chance as that of any man I know; and if, as you were mounting your horse, a friend were to say, &lsquo;Bingley, you had better stay till next week,&rsquo; you would probably do it, you would probably not go?and at another word, might stay a month."
INTJ,"You expect me to account for opinions which you choose to call mine, but which I have never acknowledged. Allowing the case, however, to stand according to your representation, you must remember, Miss Bennet, that the friend who is supposed to desire his return to the house, and the delay of his plan, has merely desired it, asked it without offering one argument in favour of its propriety."
INTJ,"Will it not be advisable, before we proceed on this subject, to arrange with rather more precision the degree of importance which is to appertain to this request, as well as the degree of intimacy subsisting between the parties?"
INTJ,"Do not you feel a great inclination, Miss Bennet, to seize such an opportunity of dancing a reel?"
INTJ,Have you anything else to propose for my domestic felicity?
INTJ,"It would not be easy, indeed, to catch their expression, but their colour and shape, and the eyelashes, so remarkably fine, might be copied."
INTJ,This walk is not wide enough for our party. We had better go into the avenue.
INTJ,"Miss Eliza Bennet, let me persuade you to follow my example, and take a turn about the room. I assure you it is very refreshing after sitting so long in one attitude."
INTJ,"I have not the smallest objection to explaining them. You either choose this method of passing the evening because you are in each other&rsquo;s confidence, and have secret affairs to discuss, or because you are conscious that your f igures appear to the greatest advantage in walking; if the first, I would be completely in your way, and if the second, I can admire you much better as I sit by the fire."
INTJ,"Miss Bingley, has given me more credit than can be. The wisest and the best of men?nay, the wisest and best of their actions? may be rendered ridiculous by a person whose first object in life is a joke"
INTJ,Perhaps that is not possible for anyone. But it has been the study of my life to avoid those weaknesses which often expose a strong un derstanding to ridicule.
INTJ,"Yes, vanity is a weakness indeed. But pride?where there is a real superiority of mind, pride will be always under good regulation."
INTJ,"No, I have made no such pretension. I have faults enough, but they are not, I hope, of understanding. My temper I dare not vouch for. It is, I believe, too little yielding?certainly too little for the convenience of the world. I cannot forget the follies and vices of other so soon as I ought, nor their offenses against myself."
INTJ,"My feelings are not puffed about with every attempt to move them. My temper would perhaps be called resentful. My good opinion once lost, is lost forever."
INTJ,"There is, I believe, in every disposition a tendency to some particular evil?a natural defect, which not even the best education can overcome. And yours, is willfully to misunderstand them."
INTJ,Very well. That reply will do for the present. Perhaps by and by I may observe that private balls are much pleasanter than public ones. But now we may be silent.
INTJ,"I am sorry you think so; but if that be the case, there can at least be no want of subject. We may compare our different opinions. The present always occupies you in such scenes?does it?"
INTJ,"May I ask to what these questions tend? And what is your success? I can readily believe, that reports may vary greatly with respect to me; and I could wish, Miss Bennet, that you were not to sketch my character at the present moment, as there is reason to fear that the performance would reflect no credit on either."
INTJ,I would by no means suspend any pleasure of yours.
INTJ,"So much the better. It cannot be done too much; and when I next write to her, I shall charge her not to neglect it on any account. I often tell young ladies that no excellence in music is to be acquired without constant practice."
INTJ," I have told Miss Bennet several times, that she will never play really well unless she practises more; and though Mrs. Collins has no instrument, she is very welcome, as I have often told her, to come to Rosings every day, and play on the pianoforte in Mrs. Jenkinson&rsquo;s room. She would be in nobody&rsquo;s way, you know, in that part of the house."
INTJ,"I shall not say you are mistaken, because you could not really believe me to entertain any design of alarming you; and I have had the pleasure of your acquaintance long enough to know that you find great enjoyment in occasionally professing opinions which in fact are not your own."
INTJ,"Perhaps, I should have judged better, had I sought 122 an introduction; but I am ill-qualified to recommend myself to strangers."
INTJ,"I certainly have not the talent which some people possess, of conversing easily with those I have never seen before. I cannot catch their tone of conversation, or appear interested in their concerns, as I often see done."
INTJ,You are perfectly right. You have em ployed your time much better. No one admitted to the privilege of hearing you can think anything wanting. We neither of us perform to strangers.
INTJ,"I should not be surprised, if he were to give it up as soon as any eligible purchase offers."
INTJ,"It is a proof of your own attachment to Hertfordshire. Anything beyond the very neighbourhood of Longbourn, I suppose, would appear far."
INTJ,You cannot have a right to such very strong local attachment. You cannot have been always at Longbourn
INTJ,In vain I have struggled. It will not do. My feelings will not be repressed. You must allow me to tell you how ardently I admire and love you.
INTJ,"And this is all the reply which I am to have the honour of expect ing! I might, perhaps, wish to be informed why, with so little endeavour at civility, I am thus rejected. But it is of small importance."
INTJ,"I have no wish of denying that I did everything in my power to separate my friend from your sister, or that I rejoice in my success. Towards him I have been kinder than towards myself. You take an eager interest in that gentleman&rsquo;s concerns."
INTJ,"His misfortunes! Yes, his mis fortunes have been great indeed."
INTJ,"And this, is your opinion of me! This is the estimation in which you hold me! I thank you for explaining it so fully. My faults, according to this calculation, are heavy indeed! But perhaps, these offenses might have been overlooked, had not your pride been hurt by my honest confession of the scruples that had long prevented my forming any serious design."
INTJ,"These bitter accusations might have been suppressed, had I, with greater policy, concealed my struggles, and flattered you into the belief of my being impelled by unqualified, unalloyed inclination; by reason, by reflection, by everything. But disguise of every sort is my abhorrence."
INTJ,"Nor am I ashamed of the feelings I related. They were natural and just. Could you expect me to rejoice in the inferiority of your connections??to congratulate myself on the hope of relations, whose condition in life is so decidedly beneath my own?"
INTJ,"You have said quite enough, madam. I perfectly comprehend your feelings, and have now only to be ashamed of what my own have been. Forgive me for having taken up so much of your time, and accept my best wishes for your health and happiness."
INTJ,"They will join me early to-morrow, and among them are some who will claim an acquaintance with you?Mr. Bingley and his sisters. There is also one other person in the party, who more particularly wishes to be known to you. Will you allow me, or doIasktoomuch, to introduce my sister to your acquaintance during your stay at Lambton?"
INTJ,"Yes, but that was only when I first saw her, for it is many months since I have considered her as one of the handsomest women of my acquaintance."
INTJ,"I am sorry, exceedingly sorry, that you have ever been informed of what may,in a mistaken light, have given you uneasiness. I did not think Mrs. Gardiner was so little to be trusted."
INTJ,"If you will thank me, let it be for yourself alone. That the wish of giving happiness to you might add force to the other in ducements which led me on, I shall not attempt to deny. But your fam ily owe me nothing. Much as I respect them, I believe I thought only of you."
INTJ,"It taught me to hope, as I had scarcely ever allowed myself to hope before. I knew enough of your disposition to be cer tain that, had you been absolutely, irrevocably decided against me, you would have acknowledged it to Lady Catherine, frankly and openly."
INTJ,"What did you say of me, that I did not deserve? For, though your accusations were ill-founded, formed on mistaken premises, my be haviour to you at the time had merited the severest reproof. It was unpardonable. I cannot think of it without abhorrence"
INTJ,"I cannot be so easily reconciled to myself. The recollection of what I then said, of my conduct, my manners, my expressions during the whole of it, is now, and has been many months, inexpressibly painful to me."
INTJ,"Your reproof, so well applied, I shall never forget: &lsquo;had you behaved in a more gentlemanlike manner.&rsquo; Those were your words. You know not, you can scarcely conceive, how they have tortured me;? though it was some time, I confess, before I was reasonable enough to allow their justice."
INTJ,"I can easily believe it. You thought methendevoidofeveryproper feeling, I am sure you did. The turn of your countenance I shall never forget, as you said that I could not have addressed you in any possible way that would induce you to accept me."
INTJ,"did it soon make you think better of me? Did you, on reading it, give any credit to its contents?"
INTJ,"I knew that what I wrote must give you pain, but it was necessary. I hope you have destroyed the letter. There was one part especially, the opening of it, which I should dread your having the power of reading again. I can remember some expressions which might justly make you hate me."
INTJ,"When I wrote that letter, I believed myself per fectly calm and cool, but I am since convinced that it was written in a dreadful bitterness of spirit."
INTJ,"I cannot give you credit for any philosophy of the kind. Your retrospections must be so totally void of reproach, that the contentment arising from them is not of philosophy, but, what is much better, of innocence. But with me, it is not so. Painful recollections will intrude which cannot, which ought not, to be repelled."
INTJ,"I have been a selfish being all my life, in practice, though not in principle. As a child I was taught what was right, butIwasnottaughttocorrectmytemper. Iwas given good principles, but left to follow them in pride and conceit."
INTJ,"Un fortunately an only son (for many years an only child), I was spoilt by my parents, who, though good themselves (my father, particularly, all that was benevolent and amiable), allowed, encouraged, almost taught me to be selfish and overbearing; tocarefornonebeyondmyownfam ily circle; to think meanly of all the rest of the world; to wish at least to think meanly of their sense and worth compared with my own."
INTJ,"Such I was, from eight to eight and twenty; and such I might still have been but for you, dearest, loveliest Elizabeth! What do I not owe you! You taught me a lesson, hard indeed at first, but most advantageous. By you, I was properly humbled. I came to you without a doubt of my reception. You showed me how insufficient were all my pretensions to please a woman worthy of being pleased."
INTJ,"My object then, was to show you,by every civility in my power, that I was not so mean as to resent the past; and I hoped to obtain your forgiveness, to lessen your ill opinion, by letting you see that your reproofs had been attended to. How soon any other wishes introduced themselves I can hardly tell, but I believe in about half an hour after I had seen you."
INTJ,"It did. Bingley is most unaffectedly modest. His diffidence had prevented his depending on his own judgment in so anxious a case,but his reliance on mine made everything easy."
INTJ,"I was obliged to confess one thing, which for a time, and not unjustly, offended him. I could not allow myself to conceal that your sister had been in town three months last winter, that I had known it, and purposely kept it from him. He was angry. But his anger, I am persuaded, lasted no longer than he remained in any doubt of your sister&rsquo;s sentiments. He has heartily forgiven me now."
