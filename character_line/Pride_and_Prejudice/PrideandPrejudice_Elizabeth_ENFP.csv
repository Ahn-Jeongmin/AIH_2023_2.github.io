ENFP,"I hope Mr. Bingley will like it, Lizzy. But you forget, mamma that we shall meet him at the assemblies, and that Mrs. Long promised to introduce him."
ENFP,"He is also handsome, which a young man ought likewise to be, if he possibly can. His character is thereby complete.Did not you? I did for you. But that is one great difference between us. Compliments always take you by surprise, and me never. What could be more natural than his asking you again?"
ENFP,"He could not help seeing that you were about five times as pretty as every other woman in the room. No thanks to his gallantry for that. Well, he certainly is very agreeable, and I give you leave to like him. You have liked many a stupider person."
ENFP,"That is very true, and I could easily forgive his pride, if he had not mortified mine."
ENFP,"But she does help him on, as much as her nature will allow. If I can perceive her regard for him, he must be a simpleton, indeed, not to discover it too."
ENFP,"But if a woman is partial to a man, and does not endeavour to conceal it, he must find it out."
ENFP,"Your plan is a good one, where nothing is in question but the desire of being well married, and if I were determined to get a rich husband, or any husband, I dare say I should adopt it. But these are not Jane&rsquo;s feelings; she is not acting by design. As yet, she cannot even be certain of the degree of her own regard nor of its reasonableness."
ENFP,"She has known him only a fortnight. She danced four dances with him at Meryton; she saw him one morning at his own house, and has since dined with him in company four times. This is not quite enough to make her understand his character."
ENFP,"Yes; these four evenings have enabled them to ascertain that they both like Vingt-un better than Commerce; but with respect to any other leading characteristic, I do not imagine that much has been unfolded"
ENFP,"You make melaugh, Charlotte; but it is not sound. You know it is not sound, and that you would never act in this way yourself."
ENFP,That is a question which Mr. Darcy only can answer.
ENFP,"That would be a good scheme, if you were sure that they would not offer to send her home. But if you have got them to-day, my mother&rsquo;s purpose will be answered."
ENFP,"I deserve neither such praise nor such censure, I am not a great reader, and I have pleasure in many things. And I wish my collection were larger for your benefit and my own credit; but I am an idle fellow, and though I have not many, I have more than I ever looked into."
ENFP,"Then, you must comprehend a great deal in your idea of an accomplished woman."
ENFP,"That is exactly what I should have supposed of you, Oh! yes?I understand you perfectly."
ENFP,"Indeed, Mamma, you are mistaken. You quite mistook Mr. Darcy. He only meant that there was not such a variety of people to be met with in the country as in the town, which you must acknowledge to be true."
ENFP,"And so ended his affection. There has been many a one, I fancy, overcome in the same way. I wonder who first discovered the efficacy of poetry in driving away love!"
ENFP,"Of a fine, stout, healthy love it may. Everything nourishes what is strong already. But if it be only a slight, thin sort of inclination, I am convinced that one good sonnet will starve it entirely away."
ENFP,"Your humility, Mr. Bingley, must disarm reproof. And which of the two do you call my little recent piece of modesty?"
ENFP,"You have only proved by this, that Mr. Bingley did not do justice to his own disposition. You have shown him off now much more than he did himself."
ENFP,Would Mr. Darcy then consider the rashness of your original in tentions as atoned for by your obstinacy in adhering to it?
ENFP,To yield readily?easily?to the persuasion of a friend is no merit with you.
ENFP,"You appear to me, Mr. Darcy, to allow nothing for the influence of friendship and affection. A regard for the requester would often make one readily yield to a request, without waiting for arguments to reason one into it. I am not particularly speaking of such a case as you have supposed about Mr. Bingley."
ENFP,"We may as well wait, perhaps, till the circumstance occurs before we discuss the discretion of his behaviour thereupon. But in general and ordinary cases between friend and friend, where one of them is desired by the other to change a resolution of no very great moment, should you think ill of that person for complying with the desire, without waiting to be argued into it?"
ENFP,"What you ask, is no sacrifice on my side; and Mr. Darcy had much better finish his letter."
ENFP,"Oh! I heard you before, but I could not immediately determine what to say in reply. You wanted me, I know, to say &lsquo;Yes,&rsquo; that you might have the pleasure of despising my taste; but I always delight in overthrowing those kind of schemes, and cheating a person of their premeditated contempt. I have, therefore, made up my mind to tell you, that I do not want to dance a reel at all?and now despise me if you dare."
ENFP,"I hope you will give your mother-in-law a few hints, when this desirable event takes place, as to the advantage of holding her tongue; and if you can compass it, do sure the younger girls of running after officers. And, if I may mention so delicate a subject, endeavour to check that little something, bordering on conceit and impertinence, which your lady possesses."
ENFP,"No, no; stay where you are. You are charmingly grouped, and appear to uncommon advantage. The picturesque would be spoilt by admitting a fourth. Good-bye."
ENFP,"Not at all, but depend upon it, he means to be severe on us, and our surest way of disappointing him will be to ask nothing about it."
ENFP,"Nothing so easy, if you have but the inclination, We can all plague and punish one another. Tease him?laugh at him. Intimate as you are, you must know how it is to be done."
ENFP,"Mr. Darcy is not to be laughed at! That is an uncommon advantage, and uncommon I hope it will continue, for it would be a great loss to me to have many such acquaintances. I dearly love a laugh."
ENFP,"Certainly, there are such people, but I hope I am not one of them. I hope I never ridicule what is wise and good. Follies and nonsense, whims and inconsistencies, do divert me, I own, and I laugh at them whenever I can. But these, I suppose, are precisely what you are without."
ENFP,Such as vanity and pride. I am perfectly convinced by it that Mr. Darcy has no defect. He owns it himself without disguise.
ENFP,That is a failing indeed! Implacable resentment is a shade in a character. But you have chosen your fault well. I really cannot laugh at it. You are safe from me.
ENFP,And your defect is to hate everybody.
ENFP,"He must be an oddity, I think, I cannot make him out.?There is something very pompous in his style.?And what can he mean by apologising for being next in the entail??We cannot sup pose he would help it if he could.?Could he be a sensible man, sir?"
ENFP,"About a month. He is a man of very large property in Derbyshire, I understand."
ENFP,"As much as I ever wish to be, I have spent four days in the same house with him, and I think him very disagreeable."
ENFP,"Upon my word, I say no more here than I might say in any house in the neighbourhood, except Netherfield. Heis notat all liked in Hertfordshire. Everybody is disgusted with his pride. You will not find him more favourably spoken of by anyone."
ENFP,"I should take him, even on my slight acquaintance, to be an ill tempered man"
ENFP,Good heavens! But how could that be? How could his will be disregarded? Why did you not seek legal redress? This is quite shocking! He deserves to be publicly disgraced.
ENFP,"But what, can have been his motive? What can have induced him to behave so cruelly? I had not thought Mr. Darcy so bad as this?though I have never liked him. I had not thought so very ill of him. I had supposed him to be despising his fellow-creatures in general, but did not suspect him of descending to such malicious revenge, such injustice, such inhumanity as this."
ENFP,"I do remember his boasting one day, at Netherfield, of the implacability of his resentments, of his having an unforgiving temper. His disposition must be dreadful."
ENFP,"To treat in such a manner the godson, the friend, the favourite of his father! A young man, too, like you, whose very countenance may vouch for your being amiable and one, too, who had probably been his companion from childhood, connected together, as I think you said, in the closest manner!"
ENFP,"How strange! How abominable! I wonder that the very pride of this Mr. Darcy has not made him just to you! If from no better motive, that he should not have been too proud to be dishonest?for dishonesty I must call it. Can such abominable pride as his have ever done him good?"
ENFP,"I am astonished at his intimacy with Mr. Bingley! How can Mr. Bingley, who seems good humour itself, and is, I really believe, truly amiable, be in friendship with such a man? How can they suit each other? Do you know Mr. Bingley?"
ENFP,"He is a sweet-tempered, amiable, charming man. He cannot know what Mr. Darcy is"
ENFP,"Lady Catherine de Bourgh, has very lately given him a living. I hardly know how Mr. Collins was first introduced to her notice, but he certainly has not known her long."
ENFP,"No, indeed, I did not. I knew nothing at all of Lady Catherine&rsquo;s connections. I never heard of her existence till the day before yesterday."
ENFP,"Mr. Collins, speaks highly both of Lady Catherine and her daughter; but from some particulars that he has related of her la dyship, I suspect his gratitude misleads him, and that in spite of her being his patroness, she is an arrogant, conceited woman."
ENFP,"Both, for I have always seen a great similarity in the turn of our minds. We are each of an unsocial, taciturn disposition, unwilling to speak, unless we expect to say something that will amaze the whole room, and be handed down to posterity with all the eclat of a proverb."
ENFP,"He has been so unlucky as to lose your friendship, and in a manner which he is likely to suffer from all his life."
ENFP,"I do not think we were speaking at all. Sir William could not have interrupted two people in the room who had less to say for themselves. We have tried two or three subjects already without success, and what we are to talk of next I cannot imagine."
ENFP,"Books?oh! no. I am sure we never read the same, or not with the same feelings. No?I cannot talk of books in a ball-room; my head is always full of something else."
ENFP,"Yes, always, I remember hearing you once say, Mr. Darcy, that you hardly ever forgave, that your resentment once created was unappeasable. You are very cautious, I suppose, as to its being created."
ENFP,"And never allow yourself to be blinded by prejudice? It is particularly incumbent on those who never change their opinion, to be secure of judging properly at first. Merely to the illustration of your character, I am trying to make it out."
ENFP,"I do not get on at all. I hear such different accounts of you as puzzle me exceedingly. But if I do not take your likeness now, I may never have another opportunity."
ENFP,"His guilt and his descent appear by your account to be the same, for I have heard you accuse him of nothing worse than of being the son of Mr. Darcy&rsquo;s steward, and of that, I can assure you, he informed me himself."
ENFP,Insolent me! You are much mistaken if you expect to influence mebysuchapaltryattack as this. I see nothing in it but your own wilful ignorance and the malice of Mr. Darcy.
ENFP,"I want to know, what you have learnt about Mr. Wickham. But perhaps you have been too pleasantly engaged to think of any third person; in which case you may be sure of my pardon. This account then is what he has received from Mr. Darcy. I am satisfied. But what does he say of the living?"
ENFP,"I have not a doubt of Mr. Bingley&rsquo;s sincerity, but you must excuse my not being convinced by assurances only. Mr. Bingley&rsquo;s defense of his friend was a very able one, I dare say; but since he is unacquainted with several parts of the story, and has learnt the rest from that friend himself, I shall venture to still think of both gentlemen as I did before."
ENFP,"You are too hasty, sir, You forget that I have made no answer. Let me do it without further loss of time. Accept my thanks for the compliment you are paying me. I am very sensible of the honour of your proposals, but it is impossible for me to do otherwise than to decline them."
ENFP,"Upon my word, sir, your hope is a rather extraordinary one after my declaration. I do assure you that I am not one of those young ladies (if such young ladies there are) who are so daring as to risk their happiness on the chance of being asked a second time. I am perfectly serious in my refusal."
ENFP,"You could not make me happy, and I am convinced that I am the last woman in the world who could make you so. Nay, were your friend Lady Catherine to know me, I am persuaded she would find me in every respect ill qualified for the situation."
ENFP,"Indeed, Mr. Collins, all praise of me will be unnecessary. You must give me leave to judge for myself, and pay me the compliment of believing what I say. I wish you very happy and very rich, and by refus ing your hand, do all in my power to prevent your being otherwise."
ENFP,"In making me the offer, you must have satisfied the delicacy of your feel ings with regard to my family, and may take possession of Longbourn estate whenever it falls, without any self-reproach. This matter may be considered, therefore, as finally settled."
ENFP,"Really, Mr. Collins, you puzzle me exceedingly. If what I have hitherto said can appear to you in the form of encouragement, I know not how to express my refusal in such a way as to convince you of its being one."
ENFP,"I do assure you, sir, that I have no pretensions whatever to that kind of elegance which consists in tormenting a respectable man. I would rather be paid the compliment of being believed sincere. I thank you again and again for the honour you have done me in your proposals, but to accept them is absolutely impossible"
ENFP,"My feelings in every respect forbid it. Can I speak plainer? Do not consider me now as an elegant female, intending to plague you, but as a rational creature, speaking the truth from her heart."
ENFP,"You must decide for yourself, and if, upon mature deliberation, you find that the misery of disobliging his two sisters is more than equivalent to the happiness of being his wife, I advise you by all means to refuse him."
ENFP,"I did not think you would; and that being the case, I cannot con sider your situation with much compassion."
ENFP,"My dear Jane! You are too good. Your sweetness and disinterestedness are really angelic; I do not know what to say to you. I feel as if I had never done you justice, or loved you as you deserve."
ENFP,"Nay, &ldquo;this is not fair. You wish to think all the world respectable, and are hurt if I speak ill of anybody. I only want to think you perfect, and you set yourself against it. Do not be afraid of my running into any excess, of my encroaching on your privilege of universal good-will. You need not."
ENFP,"There are few people whomIreally love, and still fewer of whom I think well. The more I see of the world, the more am I dissatisfied with it; and every day confirms my belief of the inconsistency of all human characters, and of the little dependence that can be placed on the appearance of merit or sense. I have met with two instances lately, one I will not mention; the other is Charlotte&rsquo;s marriage. It is unaccountable! In every view it is unaccountable!"
ENFP,"To oblige you, I would try to believe almost anything, but no one else could be benefited by such a belief as this; for were I persuaded that Charlotte had any regard for him, I should only think worse of her understanding than I now do of her heart."
ENFP,"My dear Jane, Mr. Collins is a conceited, pompous, narrow-minded, silly man; you know he is, as well as I do; and you must feel, as well as I do, that the woman who married him cannot have a proper way of thinking. You shall not defend her, though it is Charlotte Lucas."
ENFP,"You shall not, for the sake of one individual, change the meaning of principle and integrity, nor endeavour to persuade yourself or me, that selfishness is prudence, and insensibility of danger security for happiness."
ENFP,And men take care that they should.
ENFP,"I am far from attributing any part of Mr. Bingley&rsquo;s conduct to design, but without scheming to do wrong, or to make others unhappy, there may be error, and there may be misery. Thought lessness, want of attention to other people&rsquo;s feelings, and want of resolution, will do the business."
ENFP,"Yes; to the last. But if I go on, I shall displease you by saying what I think of persons you esteem. Stop me whilst you can. Yes, in conjunction with his friend."
ENFP,"Your first position is false. They may wish many things besides his happiness; they may wish his increase of wealth and consequence; they may wish him to marry a girl who has all the importance of money, great connections, and pride."
ENFP,"An excellent consolation in its way, but it will not do for us. We do not suffer by accident. It does not often happen that the interference of friends will persuade a young man of independent fortune to think no more of a girl whom he was violently in love with only a few days before."
ENFP,"I never saw a more promising inclination; he was growing quite inattentive to other people, and wholly engrossed by her. Every time they met, it was more decided and remarkable. At his own ball he offended two or three young ladies, by not asking them to dance; and I spoke to him twice myself, without receiving an answer. Could there be finer symptoms? Is not general incivility the very essence of love?"
ENFP,"As I did the other day, very true, it will be wise in me to refrain from that. But do not imagine that he is always here so often. It is on your account that he has been so frequently invited this week. You know my mother&rsquo;s ideas as to the necessity of constant company for her friends. But really, and upon my honour, I will try to do what I think to be the wisest; and now I hope you are satisfied."
ENFP,"Well, have it as you choose. He shall be mercenary, and she shall be foolish."
ENFP,"And is this all? I expected at least that the pigs were got into the garden, and here is nothing but Lady Catherine and her daughter."
ENFP,"I like her appearance. She looks sickly and cross. Yes, she will do for him very well. She will make him a very proper wife."
ENFP,"With three younger sisters grown up, your ladyship can hardly expect me to own it."
ENFP,My eldest sister has been in town these three months. Have you never happened to see her there?
ENFP,"You mean to frighten me, Mr. Darcy, by coming in all this state to hear me? I will not be alarmed though your sister does play so well. There is a stubbornness about me that never can bear to be frightened at the will of others. My courage always rises at every attempt to intimidate me."
ENFP,"Shall we ask your cousin the reason of this? Shall we ask him why a man of sense and education, and who has lived in the world, is ill qualified to recommend himself to strangers?"
ENFP,"My fingers, do not move over this instrument in the masterly manner which I see so many women&rsquo;s do. They have not the same force or rapidity, and do not produce the same expression. But then I have always supposed it to be my own fault?because I will not take the trouble of practising. It is not that I do not believe my fingers as capable as any other woman&rsquo;s of superior execution."
ENFP,"I should never have considered the distance as one of the advan tages of the match, I should never have said Mrs. Collins was settled near her family."
ENFP,"I do not mean to say that a woman may not be settled too near her family. The far and the near must be relative, and depend on many varying circumstances. Where there is fortune to make the expenses of travelling unimportant, distance becomes no evil."
ENFP,"But that is not the case here. Mr. and Mrs. Collins have a comfortable income, but not such a one as will allow of frequent journeys?and I am persuaded my friend would not call herself near her family under less than half the present distance."
ENFP,"Is this, meant for me? And pray, 128 what is the usual price of an earl&rsquo;s younger son? Unless the elder brother is very sickly, I suppose you would not ask above fifty thousand pounds."
ENFP,"I imagine your cousin brought you down with him chiefly for the sake of having someone at his disposal. I wonder he does not marry, to secure a lasting convenience of that kind. But, perhaps, his sister does as well for the present, and, as she is under his sole care, he may do what he likes with her."
ENFP,"Are you indeed? And pray what sort of guardians do you make? Does your charge give you much trouble? Young ladies of her age are sometimes a little difficult to manage, and if she has the true Darcy spirit, she may like to have her own way."
ENFP,"You need not be frightened. I never heard any harm of her; and I dare say she is one of the most tractable creatures in the world. She is a very great favourite with some ladies of my acquaintance, Mrs. Hurst and Miss Bingley. I think I have heard you say that you know them."
ENFP,"Oh! yes, Mr. Darcy is uncommonly kind to Mr. Bingley, and takes a prodigious deal of care of him. I am thinking of what you have been telling me. Your cousin&rsquo;s conduct does not suit my feelings. Why was he to be the judge?"
ENFP,"I do not see what right Mr. Darcy had to decide on the propriety of his friend&rsquo;s inclination, or why, upon his own judgement alone, he was to determine and direct in what manner his friend was to be happy. But,&rdquo; she continued, recollecting herself, &ldquo;as we know none of the particulars, it is not fair to condemn him. It is not to be supposed that there was much affection in the case."
ENFP,"In such cases as this, it is, I believe, the established mode to express a sense of obligation for the sentiments avowed, however unequally they may be returned. It is natural that obligation should be felt, and if I could feel gratitude, I would now thank you."
ENFP,"But I cannot?I have never desired your good opinion, and you have certainly bestowed it most unwillingly. I am sorry to have occasioned pain to anyone. It has been most unconsciously done, however, and I hope will be of short duration. The feelings which, you tell me, have long prevented the ac knowledgment of your regard, can have little difficulty in overcoming it after this explanation."
ENFP,"I might as well inquire, why with so evident a desire of offending and insulting me, you chose to tell me that you liked me against your will, against your reason, and even against your character? Was not this some excuse for incivility, if I was uncivil? But I have other provocations."
ENFP,"You know I have. Had not my feelings decided against you?had they been indifferent, or had they even been favourable, do you think that any consideration would tempt me to accept the man who has been the means of ruining, perhaps forever, the happiness of a most beloved sister?"
ENFP,"I have every reason in the world to think ill of you. No motive can excuse the unjust and ungenerous part you acted there. You dare not, you cannot deny, that you have been the principal, if not the only means of dividing them from each other?of exposing one to the censure of the world for caprice and instability, and the other to its derision for disappointed hopes, and involving them both in misery of the acutest kind."
ENFP,"But it is not merely this affair, on which my dis like is founded. Long before it had taken place my opinion of you was decided. Your character was unfolded in the recital which I received many months ago from Mr. Wickham. On this subject, what can you have to say? In what imaginary act of friendship can you here defend yourself? or under what misrepresentation can you here impose upon others?"
ENFP,"Who that knows what his misfortunes have been, can help feeling an interest in him?"
ENFP,"And of your infliction, you have reduced him to his present state of poverty?comparative poverty. You have withheld the advantages which you must know to have been designed for him. You have deprived the best years of his life of that independence which was no less his due than his desert. You have done all this! and yet you can treat the mention of his misfortune with contempt and ridicule."
ENFP,"You are mistaken, Mr. Darcy, if you suppose that the mode of your declaration affected me in any other way, than as it spared the concern which I might have felt in refusing you, had you behaved in a more gentlemanlike manner."
ENFP,You could not have made the offer of your hand in any possible way that would have tempted me to accept it.
ENFP,"From the very beginning?from the first moment, I may almost  say ? of my acquaintance with you, your manners, impressing me with the fullest belief of your arrogance, your conceit, and your selfish disdain of the feelings of others, were such as to form the groundwork of disapprobation on which succeeding events have built so immovable a dislike; and I had not known you a month before I felt that you were the last man in the world whom I could ever be prevailed on to marry"
ENFP,"I am much obliged to your ladyship for your kind invitation, but it is not in my power to accept it. I must be in town next Saturday."
ENFP,"Yes, that would be a delightful scheme indeed, and completely do for us at once. Good Heaven! Brighton, and a whole campful of soldiers, to us, who have been overset already by one poor regiment of militia, and the monthly balls of Meryton! And Mary King is safe! safe from a connection imprudent as to fortune."
ENFP,"Indeed, I am heartily sorry for him; but he has other feelings, which will probably soon drive away his regard for me. You do not blame me, however, for refusing him?"
ENFP,"This will not do, you never will be able to make both of them good for anything. Take your choice, but you must be satisfied with only one. There is but such a quantity of merit between them; just enough to make one good sort of man; and of late it has been shifting about pretty much. For my part, I am inclined to believe it all Darcy&rsquo;s; but you shall do as you choose."
ENFP,"If you were aware, of the very great disadvantage to us all which must arise from the public notice of Lydia&rsquo;s unguarded and imprudent manner?nay, which has already arisen from it, I am sure you would judge differently in the affair."
ENFP,"Oh, no! In essentials, I believe, he is very much what he ever was. When I said that he improved on acquaintance, I did not mean that his mind or his manners were in a state of improvement, but that, from knowing him better, his disposition was better understood."
ENFP,"And of this place, I might have been mistress! With these rooms I might now have been familiarly acquainted! Instead of viewing them as a stranger, I might have rejoiced in them as my own, and welcomed to them as visitors my uncle and aunt. But no, that could never be; my uncle and aunt would have been lost to me; I should not have been allowed to invite them"
ENFP,Why is he so altered? From what can it proceed? It cannot be for me? it cannot be for mysake that his manners are thus softened. My reproofs at Hunsford could not work such a change as this. It is impossible that he should still love me.
ENFP,"Do you really think so? Not, perhaps, of neglecting his own interest; but of every other neglect I can believe him capable. If, indeed, it should be so! But I dare not hope it. Why should they not go onto Scotland if that had been the case?"
ENFP,"It does seem, and it is most shocking indeed, that a sister&rsquo;s sense of decency and virtue in such a point should admit of doubt. But, really, I know not what to say. Perhaps I'm not doing her justice. But she's very young; she has never been taught to think on serious subjects; and for the last half-year, nay, for a twelvemonth?she has been given up to nothing but amusement and vanity."
ENFP,"She has been allowed to dispose of her time in the most idle and frivolous manner, and to adopt any opinions that came in her way. Since the ??shire were first quartered in Meryton, nothing but love, flirtation, and officers have been in her head."
ENFP,"She has been doing everything in her power by thinking and talking on the subject, to give greater?what shall I call it? susceptibility to her feelings; which are naturally lively enough. And we all know that Wickham has every charm of person and address that can captivate a woman."
ENFP,"I do indeed, I told you, the other day, of his infamous behaviour to Mr. Darcy; and you yourself, when last at Longbourn, heard in what manner he spoke of the man who had behaved with such forbearance and liberality towards him. And there are other circumstances which I am not at liberty?which it is not worthwhile to relate; but his lies about the wholePemberleyfamilyare endless."
ENFP,"From what he said of Miss Darcy I was thoroughly prepared to see a proud, reserved, disagreeable girl. Yet he knew to the contrary himself. He must know that she was as amiable and unpretending as wehave found her."
ENFP,But you?how are you? You look pale. How much you must have gone through!
ENFP,"Oh! thoughtless, thoughtless Lydia! What a letter is this, to be written at such a moment! But at least it shows that she was serious on the subject of their journey. Whatever he might afterwards persuade her to, it was not on her side a scheme of infamy. My poor father! how he must have felt it!"
ENFP,"Oh! Jane, was there a servant belonging to it who did not know the whole story before the end of the day? Your attendance upon her has been too much for you. You do not look well. Oh that I had been with you! you have had every care and anxiety upon yourself alone"
ENFP,"She had better have stayed at home, perhaps she meant well, but, under such a misfortune as this, one cannot see too little of one&rsquo;s neighbours. Assistance is impossible; condolence insufferable. Let them triumph over us at a distance, and be satisfied."
ENFP,"Oh! my dear father, come back and write immediately. Consider how important every moment is in such a case."
ENFP,"That is very true, though it had not occurred to me before. His debts to be discharged, and something still to remain! Oh! it must be my uncle&rsquo;s doings! Generous, good man, I am afraid he has distressed himself. A small sum could not do all this."
ENFP,"And they are really to be married! How strange this is! And for this we are to be thankful. That they should marry, small as is their chance of happiness, and wretched as is his character, we are forced to rejoice. Oh, Lydia!"
ENFP,"This is delightful indeed! She will be married! I shall see her again! She will be married at sixteen! My good, kind brother! I knew how it would be. I knew he would manage everything! How I long to see her! and to see dear Wickham too! But the clothes, the wedding clothes! I will write to my sister Gardiner about them directly."
ENFP,"Lizzy, my dear, run down to your father, and ask him how much he will give her. Stay, stay, I will go myself. Ring the bell, Kitty, for Hill. I will put on my things in a moment. My dear, dear Lydia! How merry we shall be together when we meet!"
ENFP,"I thank you for my share of the favour, but I do not particularly like your way of getting husbands. No really, I think there cannot be too little said on the subject."
ENFP,"This is the consequence, you see, Madam, of marrying a daughter, It must make you better satisfied that your other four are single."
ENFP,"Let me first see how he behaves, it will then be early enough for expectation. Could I expect it to be otherwise! Yet why did he come?"
ENFP,"If you believed it impossible to be true,I wonder you took the trouble of coming so far. What could your ladyship propose by it? Your coming to Longbourn, to see me and my family, will be rather a confirmation of it; if, indeed, such a report is in existence"
ENFP,I do not pretend to possess equal frankness with your ladyship. You may ask questions which I shall not choose to answer. Your ladyship has declared it to be impossible
ENFP,"These are heavy misfortunes, but the wife of Mr. Darcy must have such extraordinary sources of happiness necessarily attached to her situation, that she could, upon the whole, have no cause to repine. That will make your ladyship&rsquo;s situation at present more pitiable; but it will have no effect on me."
ENFP,"In marrying your nephew,I should not consider myself as quitting that sphere. He is a gentleman; I am a gentleman&rsquo;s daughter; so far we are equal. Whatever my connections may be, if your nephew does not object to them, they can be nothing to you."
ENFP,"You can now have nothing further to say, You have insulted me in every possible method. I must beg to return to the house. Lady Catherine, I have nothing further to say. You know my sen timents."
ENFP,"Neither duty, nor honour, nor gratitude, have any possible claim on me,in the present instance. Noprincipleofeither would be violated by my marriage with Mr. Darcy. And with regard to the resentment of his family, or the indignation of the world, if the former were excited by his marrying me, it would not give me one moment&rsquo;s concern?and the world in general would have too much sense to join in the scorn."
ENFP,"You must not blame my aunt. Lydia&rsquo;s thoughtlessness first be trayed to me that you had been concerned in the matter; and, ofcourse, I could not rest till I knew the particulars. Let me thank you again and again, in the name of all my family, for that generous compassion which induced you to take so much trouble, and bear so many mortifications, for the sake of discovering them."
ENFP,"Yes, you know enough of my frankness to believe me capable of that. After abusing you so abominably to your face, I could have no scruples abusing you to all your relations."
ENFP,"We will not quarrel for the greater share of blame annexed to that evening, the conduct of neither, if strictly examined, will be irreproachable; but since then, we have both, I hope, improved in civility"
ENFP,"The letter shall certainly be burnt, if you believe it essential to the preservation of my regard; but, though we have both reason to think my opinions not entirely unalterable, they are not, I hope, quite so eas ily changed as that implies"
ENFP,"The letter, perhaps, began in bitterness, but it did not end so. The adieu is charity itself. But think no more of the letter. The feelings of the person who wrote, and the person who received it, are now so widely different from what they were then, that every unpleasant circumstance attending it ought to be forgotten. You must learn some of my philosophy. Think only of the past as its remembrance gives you pleasure."
ENFP,"Did you speak from your own observation, when you told him that my sister loved him, or merely from my information last spring?"
