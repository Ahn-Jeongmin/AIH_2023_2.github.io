ISFJ,"I do not believe that. Snowball fought bravely at the Battle of the Cowshed. I saw him myself. did we not give him &lsquo;Animal Hero, First Class&rsquo; immediately afterwards?"
ISFJ,He was wounded. We all saw him running with blood. I do not believe that Snowball was a traitor at the beginning. What he has done since is different. But I believe that at the Battle of the Cowshed he was a good comrade.
ISFJ,"Ah, that is different! If Comrade Napoleon says it, it must be right."
ISFJ,"I do not understand it. I would not have believed that such things could happen on our farm. It must be due to some fault in ourselves. The solution, as I see it, is to work harder. From now onwards I shall get up a full hour earlier in the mornings."
ISFJ,What is that gun firing for? What victory? They have destroyed the windmill. And we had worked on it for two years! Then we have won back what we had before.
ISFJ,It is my lung. It does not matter. I think you will be able to finish the windmill without me.
ISFJ,There is a pretty good store of stone accumulated. I had only another month to go in any case.
ISFJ,"To tell you the truth, I had been looking forward to my retirement. And perhaps, as Benjamin is growing old too, they will let him retire at the same time and be a companion to me."
