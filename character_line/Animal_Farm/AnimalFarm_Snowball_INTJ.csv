INTJ,"We have no means of making sugar on this farm. Besides, you do not need sugar. You will have all the oats and hay you want!"
INTJ,"Comrade, those ribbons that you are so devoted to are the badge of slavery. Can you not understand that liberty is worth more than ribbons?"
INTJ,"Ribbons should be considered as clothes, which are the make of a human being. All animals should go naked."
INTJ,Comrades it is half-past sic and we have a long day before us. Today we begin the hay harvest. But there is another matter that must be attended to first
INTJ,"Whatever goes upon two legs is an enemy, whatever goes upon four legs, or has wings, is a friend. No animal shall wear clothes, no animal shall sleep in a bed. No animal shall drink alcohol. no animal shall kill any other animal. All animals are equal."
INTJ,"Now, comrades, to the hayfield! Let us make it a point of honour to get in the harvest more quickly than Jones and his men could do."
INTJ,"A bird&rsquo;s wing, comrades, is a organ of propulsion and not of manipulation. It should therefore be regarded as a leg. The distinguishing makr of man is the HAND, the instrument with which he does all his mischief."
INTJ,"No sentimentality, comrade. War is war. The only good human being is a dead one."
