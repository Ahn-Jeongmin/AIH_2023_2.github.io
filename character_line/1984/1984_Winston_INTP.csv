INTP,"April 4th, 1984. Last night to the flicks. All war films. One very good one of a ship full of refugees being bombed somewhere in the Mediterranean."
INTP,"Audience much amused by shots of a great huge fat man trying to swim away with a helicopter after him, first you saw him wallowing along in the water like a porpoise, then you saw him through the helicopters gunsights, then he was full of holes and the sea round him turned pink and he sank as suddenly as though the holes had let in the water, audience shouting with laughter when he sank then you saw a lifeboat full of children with a helicopter hovering over it."
INTP,There was a middle-aged woman might have been a Jewess sitting up in the bow with a little boy about three years old in her arms.
INTP,little boy screaming with fright and hiding his head between her breasts as if he was trying to burrow right into her and the woman putting her arms round him and comforting him although she was blue with fright herself.
INTP,all the time covering him up as much as possible as if she thought her arms could keep the bullets off him.
INTP,then the helicopter planted a 20 kilo bomb in among them terrific flash and the boat went all to matchwood.
INTP,then there was a wonderful shot of a child's arm going up up up right up into the air a helicopter with a camera in its nose must have followed it up and there was a lot of applause from the party seats but a woman down in the prole part of the house suddenly started kicking up a fuss and shouting they didnt oughter of showed it not in front of kids they didnt it aint right not in front of kids it aint until the police turned her turned her out i dont suppose anything happened to her nobody cares what the proles say typical prole reaction they
INTP,"I've tried all over the place. They don&rsquo;t exist any longer. I was working. I shall see it on the flicks, I suppose."
INTP,I think he was a little upset at no going to the execution. What did they do for that? Of course we can&rsquo;t afford to take chances.
INTP,"Not one, I&rsquo;ve been using the same blade for six weeks myself. Sorry."
INTP," It was three years ago. It was a dark evening, in a narrow side-street near one of the big railway stations. She was standing near a doorway in the wall, under a street lamp that hardly gave any light."
INTP,"She had a young face, painted very thick. It was really the paint that appealed to me, the whiteness of it, like a mask, and the bright red lips"
INTP,"Party women never paint their faces. There was nobody else in the street, and no telescreens. She said two dollars."
INTP,"For the moment it was too difficult to go on. He shut his eyes and pressed his fingers against them, trying to squeeze out the vision that kept recurring."
INTP,"He had an almost overwhelming temptation to shout a string of filthy words at the top of his voice. Or to bang his head against the wall, to kick over the table, and hurl the inkpot through the window -- to do any violent or noisy or painful thing that might black out the memory that was tormenting him."
INTP,"Your worst enemy, he reflected, was your own nervous system. At any moment the tension inside you was liable to translate itself into some visible symptom."
INTP,"He thought of a man whom he had passed in the street a few weeks back; a quite ordinary-looking man, a Party member, aged thirty-five to forty, tallish and thin, carrying a brief-case."
INTP,They were a few metres apart when the left side of the man's face was suddenly contorted by a sort of spasm.
INTP,"It happened again just as they were passing one another: it was only a twitch, a quiver, rapid as the clicking of a camera shutter, but obviously habitual."
INTP,He remembered thinking at the time: That poor devil is done for. And what was frightening was that the action was quite possibly unconscious. The most deadly danger of all was talking in your sleep.
INTP,"There was no way of guarding against that, so far as he could see.I went with her through the doorway and across a backyard into a basement kitchen."
INTP,"There was a bed against the wall, and a lamp on the table, turned down very low. She¡¦"
INTP,"When I saw her in the light she was quite an old woman, fifty years old at least. But I went ahead and did it just the same."
INTP,"Until they become conscious they will never rebel, and until after they have rebelled they cannot become conscious."
INTP,"I understand HOW, I don&rsquo;t understand WHY."
INTP,"If there is hope, it lies in the proles."
INTP,Steamer! Look out guv&rsquo;nor! Bang over&rsquo;ead! Lay down quickly!
INTP,"You must have seen great changes since you were a young man. You are very much older than I am. You must have been a grown man before I was born. You can remember what it was like in the old days, before the Revolution."
INTP,"People of my age don&rsquo;t really know anything about those times. We can only read about them in books, and what is says in the book may be not true."
INTP," I should like your opinion on that. The history books says that life before the Revolution was completely different from what it is now. There was the most terrible oppression, injustice, poverty worse than anything we can imagine."
INTP,"Here in London, the great mass of the people never had enough to eat from birth to death. Half of them hadn&rsquo;t even boots on their feet."
INTP,"They worked twelve hours a day, they left school at nine, they slept ten in a room. And at the same time there were a very few people, only a few thousands who were rich and powerful. They owned everything that there was to own. They lived in great gorgeous houses with thirty servants,¡¦"
INTP,"It isn&rsquo;t very important about the top hats. The point is, these capitalists ? they and a few lawyers and priests and so forth who lived on them ? were the lords of the earth."
INTP,Everything existed for their benefit. You were the slaves. They could do what they liked with you. They could ship you off to Canada like cattle.
INTP,What I really want to know was this. Do you feel that you have more freedom now than you had in those days? Are you treated more like human being?
INTP,And was it usual ? I&rsquo;m only quoting what I&rsquo;ve read in history books ? was it usual for these people and their servants to push you off the pavement into the gutter?
INTP,"Perhaps I have not made myself clear, what I&rsquo;m trying to say is this. You have been alive a very long time; you lived half your life before Revolution. In 1925, for instance, you were already grown up. Would you say from what you can remember, that life in 1925 was better than it is now, or worse? If you could choose, would you prefer to live the or now?"
INTP,I know that building. It&rsquo;s a ruin now. It&rsquo;s in the middle of the street outside the Palace of Justice.
INTP,"Would you believe, that till this moment I didn&rsquo;t know what colour your eye were? Now that you&rsquo;ve seen what I&rsquo;m really like, can you still bear to look at me? I&rsquo;m thirty -nine years old. I&rsquo;ve got a wife that I can&rsquo;t get rid of. I&rsquo;ve got varicose veins. I &lsquo;ve got five false teeth."
INTP,"I hated the sight of you. I wanted to rape you and the murder you afterwards. Two weeks ago, I thought seriously of smashing your head in with a cobblestone. If you really want to know, I imagined that you had something to do with the Thought Police."
INTP,"Well, perhaps not exactly that, But from your general appearance ? merely because you&rsquo;re young and fresh and healthy, you understand ? I thought that probably. Yes, something of that kind. A great many young girls are like that, you know."
INTP,You are young. You are ten or fifteen years younger than I am. What could you see to attract you in a man like me?
INTP,"Listen. The more men you&rsquo;ve had, the more I love you. Do you understand that? I hate purity, I hate goodness! I don&rsquo;t want any virtue to exist anywhere. I want everybody to be corrupted to the bones."
INTP,You like doing this? I don&rsquo;t mean simply me: I mean the thing in itself?
INTP,Look Katherine! Look at those flowers. That clump down near the bottom. Do you see they&rsquo;re two different coulours?
INTP,"Yes dear, you would have. I would, if I&rsquo;d been the same person then as I am now. Or perhaps I would I&rsquo;m not certain. Actually it would have made no difference."
INTP,"Only because I prefer a positive to a negative. In this game that we&rsquo;re playing, we can&rsquo;t win. Some kinds of failure are better than other kinds, that&rsquo;s all."
INTP,"We are dead. Not physically. Six months, a year ? five years, conceivably. I am afraid of death. You are young, so presumably put it off as long as we can. But it makes very little difference. So long as human beings stay human, death and life are the same thing."
INTP,"I don&rsquo;t think it&rsquo;s anything ? I mean, I don&rsquo;t think it was ever put to any use. That&rsquo;s what I like about it. It&rsquo;s a little chunk of history that they&rsquo;ve forgotten to alter. It&rsquo;s a message from a hundred years ago, if one knew how to read it."
INTP,"More. Two hundred, I dare say. One can&rsquo;t tell. It&rsquo;s impossible to discover the age of anything nowadays. It&rsquo;s a church, or at least it used to be. St. Clement&rsquo;s Danes its name was. Oranges and lemons, say the bells of St.Clement&rsquo;s!"
INTP,"Not much, perhaps. But it was evidence. It might have planted a few doubts here and there, supposing that I&rsquo;d dared to show it to anybody. I don&rsquo;t imagine that we can alter anything in our own lifetime."
INTP,"But one can imagine little knots of resistance springing up here and there ? small groups of people banding themselves together, and gradually growing, and even leaving a few records behind, so that the next generations can carry on where we leave off."
INTP,I am only an amateur. It&rsquo;s not my subject. I have never had anything to do with the actual construction of the language.
INTP,I didn&rsquo;t think it had been issued yet. We are still using the ninth in the Records Department.
INTP,Do you know that until this moment I believed I had murdered my mother? Not physically.
INTP,"The proles are human beings. We are not human. Has it ever occurred to you, that the best thin for us to do would be simply to walk out here before it&rsquo;s too late, and never see each other again? We&rsquo;ve been lucky, but it can&rsquo;t last much long. You are young. You look normal and innocent. If you keep clear of people like me, you might stay alive for another fifty years."
INTP,"We may be together for another six months ? a year ? there&rsquo;s no knowing. At the end we&rsquo;re certain to be apart. Do you realize how utterly alone we shall be? When once they get hold of us there will be nothing, literally nothing, that either of us can do for the other. If I confess, they&rsquo;ll shoot you, and if I refuse to confess, they&rsquo;ll shoot you just the same."
INTP,"Nothing that I can do or say, or stop myself from saying, will put off your death for as much as five minutes. Neither of us will even know whether the other is alive or dead. We shall be utterly without power of any kind."
INTP,"The one thing that matters is that we shouldn&rsquo;t betray one another, although even that can&rsquo;t make the slightest difference."
INTP,I don&rsquo;t mean confessing. Confession is not betrayal. What you say or do doesn&rsquo;t matter: only feelings matter. F they could make me stop loving you ? that would be the real betrayal.
INTP,"No. That&rsquo;s quite true. They can&rsquo;t get inside you. If you can feel that staying human is worth while, even when it can&rsquo;t have any result whatever, you&rsquo;ve beaten them."
INTP,"Did you ever happen to hear an old rhyme that begins Oranges and lemons, way the bells of St Clementine&rsquo;s?"
INTP,"Comrade! Officer! You don&rsquo;t have to take me to that place! Haven&rsquo;t I told you everything already? What else is it you want to know? There&rsquo;s nothing I wouldn&rsquo;t confess, nothing! Just tell me what it is and I&rsquo;ll confess straight off. Write it down and I&rsquo;ll sign it _ anything! Not room 101!"
INTP,Do anything to me! You&rsquo;ve been starving me for weeks. Finish it off and let me die. Shoot me. Hang me. Sentence me to twenty-five years. Is there somebody else you want me to give away?
INTP,"Just say who it is and I&rsquo;ll tell you anything you want. I don&rsquo;t care who it is or what you do to them. I&rsquo;ve got a wife and three children. The biggest of them isn&rsquo;t six years old. You can take the whole lot of them and cut their throats in front of mt eyes, and I&rsquo;ll stand by and watch it. But not Room 101!"
INTP,"That&rsquo;s the one you ought to be taking, not me! You didn&rsquo;t hear what he was saying after they bashed his face. Give me a chance and I&rsquo;ll tell you every word of it. He&rsquo;s the one that&rsquo;s against the Party, not me. You didn&rsquo;t hear him. Something went wrong with the telescreen. He&rsquo;s the one you want. Take him, not me!"
INTP,"When I was arrested, Oceania was at war with Eastasia. I remember that until only a week before I was arrested, we were not at war with Eastasia at all. We were in alliance with them."
INTP,The war was against Eurasia. That had lasted for four years. But it did exist! It does exist! It exists in memory. I remember it. You remember it.
INTP,Who controls the past controls the future; who controls the present controls the present.
INTP,But how can you stop people remembering things? It is involuntary. It is outside oneself. How can you control memory? You have not controlled mine!
INTP,You can&rsquo;t! You could not create such a world as you have just described. It is a dream. It is impossible. It is impossible to found a civilization on fear and hatred and cruelty. It would never endure. It would have no vitality. It would disintegrate. It would commit suicide. I don&rsquo;t know - I don&rsquo;t care. Somehow you will fail. Something will defeat you. Life will defeat you.
INTP,"I don&rsquo;t care. In the end they will beat you. Sooner or later they will see you for what you are, and then they will tear you to pieces. No I believe it. I know you will fail. There is something in the universe - I don&rsquo;t know, some spirit, some principle - that you will never overcome. Yes, I consider myself superior."
