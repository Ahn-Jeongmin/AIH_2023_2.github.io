ESTP,"I didn&rsquo;t want to say anything in the lane, in case there&rsquo;s a mike hidden there. I don&rsquo;t suppose there is, but there could be. There&rsquo;s always the chance of one of those swine recognizing your voice. We&rsquo;re all right here. Yes, look at the trees. There&rsquo;s nothing big enough to hide a mike in. Besides, I&rsquo;ve been here before."
ESTP,"Never mind, dear. There&rsquo;s no hurry. We&rsquo;ve got the whole afternoon. Isn&rsquo;t this a splendid hide-out? I found it when I got lost once on a community hike. If anyone was coming you could hear them a hundred meters away."
ESTP,"I expect I&rsquo;m better at finding things out than you are, dear. Tell me, what did you think of me before that day I gave you the note?"
ESTP,"You thought I was a good party member. Pure in word and deed. Banners, processions, slogans, games, community hikes all that stud. And you thought that if I had a quarter of a chance I&rsquo;d denounce you as a thought ? criminal and get you killed off?"
ESTP,"Actually I am that sort of girl, to look at. I&rsquo;m good at games. I was a troop-leader in the Spies. I do voluntary work tree evenings a week for the Junior Anti-Sex League. Hours and hours I&rsquo;ve spent pasting their bloody rot all over London."
ESTP,"I always carry one end of a banner in the procession. I always look cheerful and I never shirk anything. Always yell with the crowd, that&rsquo;s what I say. It&rsquo;s the only way to be safe."
ESTP,It was something in your face. I thought I&rsquo;d take a chance. I&rsquo;m good at spotting people who don&rsquo;t belong. As soon as I saw you I knew you were against them.
ESTP,Don&rsquo;t go out into the open. There might be someone watching. We&rsquo;re all right if we keep behind the boughs.
ESTP,"That&rsquo;s right, there is a stream. It&rsquo;s at the edge of the next field, actually. There are fish in it, great big ones. You can watch them lying in the pools under the willow trees, waving their tails."
ESTP,"Not with those swine, no. But there&rsquo;s plenty that would if they got half a chance. They&rsquo;re not so holy as they make out."
ESTP,"We can come here once again. It&rsquo;s generally safe to use any hide-out twice. But not for another month or two, of course."
ESTP,"And now I must go. I&rsquo;m due back at nineteen-thirty. I&rsquo;ve got to put in two hours for the Junior Anti-Sex League, handling out leaflets, or something. Isn&rsquo;t it bloody? Give me a brush-down, would you? Have I got any twigs in my hair? Are you sure? Then good-bye, my love, good-bye!"
ESTP,"Oh ghastly rubbish. They&rsquo;re boring, really. They only have six plots, but they swap them round a bit. Of course I was only on the kaleidoscopes. I was never in the Rewrite Squad. I&rsquo;m not literally, dear ? not even enough for that."
ESTP,They don&rsquo;t like having married women there. Girls are always supposed to be so pure. Here&rsquo;s one who isn&rsquo;t anyway.
ESTP,"I&rsquo;ve been at school too, dear. Sex talks once a month for the over-sixteens. And in the Youth Movement. They rub it into you for years. I dare say it works in a lot of cases. But of course you can never tell; people are such hypocrites."
ESTP,"When you make love you&rsquo;re using up energy; and afterwards you feel happy and don&rsquo;t give a damn for anything. They can&rsquo;t bear you to feel like that. They want you to be bursting with energy all the time. All this marching up and down and cheering and waving flags is simply sex gone sour. If you&rsquo;re happy inside yourself, why should you get excited about Big Brother and the Three Year-Plans and the Two Minute Hate and all the rest of their bloody rot?"
ESTP,"Oh rubbish! Which would you sooner sleep with, me or a skeleton? Don&rsquo;t you enjoy being alive? Don&rsquo;t you like feeling : This is me, this is my hand, this is my leg, I&rsquo;m real, I&rsquo;m solid, I&rsquo;m alive! Don&rsquo;t you like this? Then stop talking about dying. And now listen, dear, we&rsquo;ve got to fix up about the next time we meet. We may as well go back to the place in the wood. We&rsquo;ve given it a good long rest. But you must get there by a different way this time."
ESTP,"Yes, dear, scent too. And do you know what I&rsquo;m going to do next? I&rsquo;m going to get hold of a real woman&rsquo;s frock from somewhere and wear silk stockings and high-heeled shoes! In this room I&rsquo;m going to be a woman, not a Party comrade."
ESTP,We&rsquo;ve even got them in the kitchen at the hostel. Some parts of London are swarming with them. Did you know they attack children? In some of these streets a woman daren&rsquo;t leave a baby alone for two minutes. It&rsquo;s the great huge brown ones that do it.
ESTP,My grandfather. He used to say it to me when I was a little girl. He was vaporized when I was eight. I wonder what a lemon was. I&rsquo;ve seen oranges. They&rsquo;re a kind of round yellow fruit with a thick skin.
ESTP,I&rsquo;ll take it down and give it a good clean some day. It washing this paint off. What a bore! I&rsquo;ll get the lipstick off your face afterwards.
ESTP,"I&rsquo;m quite ready to take risks, but only for something worth while, not for bits of old newspaper. What could you have done with it even if you had kept it? I&rsquo;m not interested in the next generation, dear. I&rsquo;m interested in us."
ESTP,"Yes dear, it has occurred to me, several times. But I&rsquo;m not going to do it, all the same. No, I&rsquo;ve thought it all out. What you do, I&rsquo;m going to do. And don&rsquo;t be too downhearted. I&rsquo;m rather good at staying alive."
ESTP,"If you mean confessing, we shall do that, right enough. Everybody always confesses. You can&rsquo;t help it. They torture you. It&rsquo;s the one thing they can&rsquo;t do. They can make you say anything, but they can&rsquo;t make you believe it. They can&rsquo;t get inside you"
ESTP,He wasn&rsquo;t singing to us. He was singing to please himself. Not even that. He was just singing.
ESTP,"I betrayed you. Sometimes, they threaten you with something - something you can&rsquo;t stand up to, can&rsquo;t even think about. And then you say, &ldquo;don&rsquo;t do it to me, do it to somebody else, do it to so- and - so.&rdquo; And perhaps you might pretend, afterwards, that it was only a trick and that you just said it to make them stop and didn&rsquo;t really mean it. But that isn&rsquo;t true."
ESTP,"At the time when it happens you do mean it. You think there is no other way of saving yourself, and you are quite ready to save yourself that way. You want it to happen to the other person. You don&rsquo;t give a damn what they suffer. All you care about is yourself. And after that, you don&rsquo;t feel the same towards the other person any longer."
