ISFJ,"The whole town is desolate. All the cars have the left rear wheel painted black as a mourning wreath, and there’s a persistent wail all night along the north shore."
ISFJ,"Hold on, I have to leave you here. Well, I’d like to, but ——. I live at West Egg. I live next door to him."
ISFJ,"Why, yes. I was in the Ninth Machine-gun Battalion. Much better. This is an unusual party for me. I haven’t even seen the host. I live over there —— and this man Gatsby sent over his chauffeur with an invitation. What! Oh, I beg your pardon."
ISFJ,"Where is he from, I mean? And what does he do? Why not?"
ISFJ,"No, you’re not. What’s that got to do with it? Suppose you met somebody just as careless as yourself."
ISFJ,"Anything can happen now that we’ve slid over this bridge, anything at all. . . ."
ISFJ,I don’t like mysteries. And I don’t understand why you won’t come out frankly and tell me what you want. Why has it all got to come through Miss Baker?
ISFJ,"Have you known Gatsby for a long time? Well! That’s a very interesting idea. Come along with me for a minute, I’ve got to say hello to some one. I’ve been having lunch with Mr. Gatsby."
ISFJ,Did I have to know all this before he could ask such a little thing? Why didn’t he ask you to arrange a meeting?
ISFJ,"Your place looks like the World’s Fair, I’ve got to go to bed. I talked with Miss Baker, I’m going to call up Daisy to-morrow and invite her over here to tea. What day would suit you? Would you rather put it off for a few days?"
ISFJ,"I’ve got my hands full, I’m much obliged but I couldn’t take on any more work."
ISFJ,That’s the secret of Castle Rackrent. Tell your chauffeur to go far away and spend an hour.
ISFJ,"You’re acting like a little boy. Not only that, but you’re rude. Daisy’s sitting in there all alone"
ISFJ,I wouldn’t ask too much of her. You can’t repeat the past.
ISFJ,"Is Mr. Gatsby sick? I hadn’t seen him around, and I was rather worried. Tell him Mr. Carraway came over. Carraway."
ISFJ,Going away? I hear you fired all your servants.
ISFJ,"No, thanks. But I’d be glad if you’d order me the taxi. I’ll wait outside. No, thanks."
ISFJ,"Yes, it’s all quiet. You’d better come home and get some sleep. You ought to go away. It’s pretty certain they’ll trace your car. Go to Atlantic City for a week, or up to Montreal."
ISFJ,"I’ll call you up, I’ll call you about noon. I suppose Daisy’ll call too. Well, good-by. They’re a rotten crowd, You’re worth the whole damn bunch put together. Good-by, I enjoyed breakfast, Gatsby."
ISFJ,"I’ll get somebody for you, Gatsby. Don’t worry. Just trust me and I’ll get somebody for you —— they were chance visitors, all these official people who suddenly filled it."
ISFJ,"Now he’s dead. You were his closest friend, so I know you’ll want to come to his funeral this afternoon. There’s nothing to get mixed up in. It’s all over now."
ISFJ,"I’m thirty, I’m five years too old to lie to myself and call it honor."
ISFJ,"Gatsby believed in the green light, the orgastic future that year by year recedes before us. It eluded us then, but that’s no matter — to-morrow we will run faster, stretch out our arms farther. . . . And one fine morning —— So we beat on, boats against the current, borne back ceaselessly into the past."
