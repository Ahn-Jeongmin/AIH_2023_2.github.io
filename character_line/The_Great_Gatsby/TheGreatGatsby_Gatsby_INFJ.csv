INFJ,"Your face is familiar, weren&rsquo;t you in the Third Division during the war? I was in the Seventh Infantry until June nineteen-eighteen. I knew I&rsquo;d seen you somewhere before. Want to go with me, old sport? Just near the shore along the Sound. Any time that suits you best."
INFJ," I&rsquo;m Gatsby, I thought you knew, old sport. I&rsquo;m afraid I&rsquo;m not a very good host. If you want anything just ask for it, old sport. Excuse me. I will rejoin you later."
INFJ,"Don&rsquo;t mention it. Don&rsquo;t give it another thought, old sport. And don&rsquo;t forget we&rsquo;re going up in the hydroplane to-morrow morning, at nine o&rsquo;clock."
INFJ,"Good morning, old sport. You&rsquo;re having lunch with me to-day and I thought we&rsquo;d ride up together. t&rsquo;s pretty, isn&rsquo;t it, old sport? Haven&rsquo;t you ever seen it before?"
INFJ,"What&rsquo;s your opinion of me, anyhow? Well, I&rsquo;m going to tell you something about my life. I don&rsquo;t want you to get a wrong idea of me from all these stories you hear."
INFJ,"I&rsquo;ll tell you God&rsquo;s truth. I am the son of some wealthy people in the Middle West ? all dead now. I was brought up in America but educated at Oxford, because all my ancestors have been educated there for many years. It is a family tradition."
INFJ,"My family all died and I came into a good deal of money. After that I lived like a young rajah in all the capitals of Europe ? Paris, Venice, Rome ? collecting jewels, chiefly rubies, hunting big game, painting a little, things for myself only, and trying to forget something very sad that had happened to me long ago."
INFJ,"Then came the war, old sport. It was a great relief, and I tried very hard to die, but I seemed to bear an enchanted life."
INFJ,I accepted a commission as first lieutenant when it began. In the Argonne Forest I took two machine-gun detachments so far forward that there was a half mile gap on either side of us where the infantry couldn&rsquo;t advance.
INFJ,"We stayed there two days and two nights, a hundred and thirty men with sixteen Lewis guns, and when the infantry came up at last they found the insignia of three German divisions among the piles of dead. I was promoted to be a major, and every Allied government gave me a decoration ? even Montenegro, little Montenegro down on the Adriatic Sea!"
INFJ,"I&rsquo;m going to make a big request of you to-day, so I thought you ought to know something about me. I didn&rsquo;t want you to think I was just some nobody. You see, I usually find myself among strangers because I drift here and there trying to forget the sad thing that happened to me. You&rsquo;ll hear about it this afternoon. No, this afternoon. I happened to find out that you&rsquo;re taking Miss Baker to tea. No, old sport, I&rsquo;m not. But Miss Baker has kindly consented to speak to you about this matter."
INFJ,"I was able to do the commissioner a favor once, and he sends me a Christmas card every year."
INFJ,"Look here, old sport, I&rsquo;m afraid I made you a little angry this morning in the car. Oh, it&rsquo;s nothing underhand. Miss Baker&rsquo;s a great sportswoman, you know, and she&rsquo;d never do anything that wasn&rsquo;t all right."
INFJ,He becomes very sentimental sometimes. This is one of his sentimental days. He&rsquo;s quite a character around New York ? a denizen of Broadway.
INFJ,I don&rsquo;t want to do anything out of the way! I want to see her right next door.
INFJ,"Oh, that&rsquo;s all right, I don&rsquo;t want to put you to any trouble. How about the day after to-morrow? I want to get the grass cut. Oh, it isn&rsquo;t about that. At least ?? Why, I thought ? why, look here, old sport, you don&rsquo;t make much money, do you?"
INFJ,"I thought you didn&rsquo;t, if you&rsquo;ll pardon my ? You see, I carry on a little business on the side, a sort of side line, you understand. And I thought that if you don&rsquo;t make very much ? You&rsquo;re selling bonds, aren&rsquo;t you, old sport? Well, this would interest you. It wouldn&rsquo;t take up much of your time and you might pick up a nice bit of money. It happens to be a rather confidential sort of thing."
INFJ,"I&rsquo;ve got to speak to you about something before you go. Oh, God! This is a terrible mistake, a terrible, terrible mistake. She&rsquo;s embarrassed? Don&rsquo;t talk so loud."
INFJ,"I want you and Daisy to come over to my house, I&rsquo;d like to show her around."
INFJ,"I did, old sport, but I lost most of it in the big panic ? the panic of the war. Oh, I&rsquo;ve been in several things, I was in the drug business and then I was in the oil business. But I&rsquo;m not in either one now. Do you mean you&rsquo;ve been thinking over what I proposed the other night?"
INFJ,"I keep it always full of interesting people, night and day. People who do interesting things. Celebrated people. I&rsquo;ve got a man in England who buys me clothes. He sends over a selection of things at the beginning of each season, spring and fall. If it wasn&rsquo;t for the mist we could see your home across the bay, you always have a green light that burns all night at the end of your dock."
INFJ,"I&rsquo;m delighted to see you, I&rsquo;m delighted that you dropped in. Sit right down. Have a cigarette or a cigar.I&rsquo;ll have something to drink for you in just a minute. Please don&rsquo;t hurry. Why don&rsquo;t you ? why don&rsquo;t you stay for supper? I wouldn&rsquo;t be surprised if some other people dropped in from New York."
INFJ,"She didn&rsquo;t like it. She didn&rsquo;t like it, she didn&rsquo;t have a good time. I feel far away from her. It&rsquo;s hard to make her understand. The dance? Old sport, the dance is unimportant. And she doesn&rsquo;t understand, She used to be able to understand. We&rsquo;d sit for hours ?? Can&rsquo;t repeat the past? Why of course you can! I&rsquo;m going to fix everything just the way it was before, she&rsquo;ll see."
INFJ,"No, old sport. I wanted somebody who wouldn&rsquo;t gossip. Daisy comes over quite often ? in the afternoons. They&rsquo;re some people Wolfsheim wanted to do something for. They&rsquo;re all brothers and sisters. They used to run a small hotel."
INFJ,"I can&rsquo;t say anything in his house, old sport. Her voice is full of money."
INFJ,"Why not let her alone, old sport? You&rsquo;re the one that wanted to come to town."
INFJ,"I told you I went there. It was in nineteen-nineteen, I only stayed five months. That&rsquo;s why I can&rsquo;t really call myself an Oxford man. It was an opportunity they gave to some of the officers after the Armistice, We could go to any of the universities in England or France."
INFJ,"Your wife doesn&rsquo;t love you. She&rsquo;s never loved you. She loves me. She never loved you, do you hear? She only married you because I was poor and she was tired of waiting for me. It was a terrible mistake, but in her heart she never loved any one except me!"
INFJ,"I told you what&rsquo;s been going on, going on for five years ? and you didn&rsquo;t know. No, we couldn&rsquo;t meet. But both of us loved each other all that time, old sport, and you didn&rsquo;t know. I used to laugh sometimes to think that you didn&rsquo;t know."
INFJ,"Daisy, that&rsquo;s all over now. It doesn&rsquo;t matter any more. Just tell him the truth ? that you never loved him ? and it&rsquo;s all wiped out forever. You never loved him."
INFJ,"You don&rsquo;t understand. You&rsquo;re not going to take care of her any more. Daisy&rsquo;s leaving you. You can suit yourself about that, old sport. I guess your friend Walter Chase wasn&rsquo;t too proud to come in on it. He came to us dead broke. He was very glad to pick up some money, old sport."
INFJ,"I thought so; I told Daisy I thought so. It&rsquo;s better that the shock should all come at once. She stood it pretty well. But of course I&rsquo;ll say I was. You see, when we left New York she was very nervous and she thought it would steady her to drive ? and this woman rushed out at us just as we were passing a car coming the other way."
INFJ,"It all happened in a minute, but it seemed to me that she wanted to speak to us, thought we were somebody she knew. Well, first Daisy turned away from the woman toward the other car, and then she lost her nerve and turned back."
INFJ,"The second my hand reached the wheel I felt the shock ? it must have killed her instantly. Anyhow ? Daisy stepped on it. I tried to make her stop, but she couldn&rsquo;t, so I pulled on the emergency brake. Then she fell over into my lap and I drove on."
INFJ,"I&rsquo;m just going to wait here and see if he tries to bother her about that unpleasantness this afternoon. She&rsquo;s locked herself into her room, and if he tries any brutality she&rsquo;s going to turn the light out and on again."
INFJ,"Nothing happened. I waited, and about four o&rsquo;clock she came to the window and stood there for a minute and then turned out the light."
INFJ,"Of course she might have loved him just for a minute, when they were first married ? and loved me more even then, do you see?"
INFJ,"Look here, old sport, you&rsquo;ve got to get somebody for me. You&rsquo;ve got to try hard. I can&rsquo;t go through this alone."
