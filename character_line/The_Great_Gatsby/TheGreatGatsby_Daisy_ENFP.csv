ESFP,"I&rsquo;m p-paralyzed with happiness. Do they miss me? How gorgeous! Let&rsquo;s go back, Tom. To-morrow! You ought to see the baby. She&rsquo;s asleep. She&rsquo;s three years old. Haven&rsquo;t you ever seen her?"
ESFP,"Don&rsquo;t look at me, I&rsquo;ve been trying to get you to New York all afternoon. In two weeks it&rsquo;ll be the longest day in the year. Do you always watch for the longest day of the year and then miss it? I always watch for the longest day in the year and then miss it."
ESFP,"I know you didn&rsquo;t mean to, but you did do it. That&rsquo;s what I get for marrying a brute of a man, a great, big, hulking physical specimen of a ?? Hulking,"
ESFP,"I love to see you at my table, Nick. You remind me of a ? of a rose, an absolute rose. Doesn&rsquo;t he? An absolute rose?"
ESFP,"I looked outdoors for a minute, and it&rsquo;s very romantic outdoors. There&rsquo;s a bird on the lawn that I think must be a nightingale come over on the Cunard or White Star Line. He&rsquo;s singing away ?? It&rsquo;s romantic, isn&rsquo;t it, Tom?"
ESFP,"It&rsquo;ll show you how I&rsquo;ve gotten to feel about ? things. Well, she was less than an hour old and Tom was God knows where. I woke up out of the ether with an utterly abandoned feeling, and asked the nurse right away if it was a boy or a girl."
ESFP,"She told me it was a girl, and so I turned my head away and wept. &lsquo;all right,&rsquo; I said, &lsquo;I&rsquo;m glad it&rsquo;s a girl. And I hope she&rsquo;ll be a fool ? that&rsquo;s the best thing a girl can be in this world, a beautiful little fool."
ESFP,"You see I think everything&rsquo;s terrible anyhow, everybody thinks so ? the most advanced people. And I know. I&rsquo;ve been everywhere and seen everything and done everything. Sophisticated ? God, I&rsquo;m sophisticated!"
ESFP,"In fact I think I&rsquo;ll arrange a marriage. Come over often, Nick, and I&rsquo;ll sort of ? oh ? fling you together. You know ? lock you up accidentally in linen closets and push you out to sea in a boat, and all that sort of thing ?"
ESFP,"Her family is one aunt about a thousand years old. Besides, Nick&rsquo;s going to look after her, aren&rsquo;t you, Nick? She&rsquo;s going to spend lots of week-ends out here this summer. I think the home influence will be very good for her."
ESFP,"Is this absolutely where you live, my dearest one? Are you in love with me,or why did I have to come alone?"
ESFP,"I love it, but I don&rsquo;t see how you live there all alone."
ESFP,"They&rsquo;re such beautiful shirts. It makes me sad because I&rsquo;ve never seen such ? such beautiful shirts before. Look at that, I&rsquo;d like to just get one of those pink clouds and put you in it and push you around."
ESFP,"If you want to kiss me any time during the evening, Nick, just let me know and I&rsquo;ll be glad to arrange it for you. Just mention my name. Or present a green card. I&rsquo;m giving out green ??I&rsquo;ve never met so many celebrities! I liked that man ? what was his name? ? with the sort of blue nose."
ESFP,"Lots of people come who haven&rsquo;t been invited. That girl hadn&rsquo;t been invited. They simply force their way in and he&rsquo;s too polite to object. I can tell you right now, he owned some drug-stores, a lot of drug-stores. He built them up himself. Good night, Nick."
ESFP,"Bles-sed pre-cious. Come to your own mother that loves you. The bles-sed pre-cious! Did mother get powder on your old yellowy hair? Stand up now, and say ? How-de-do"
ESFP,"What&rsquo;ll we do with ourselves this afternoon? and the day after that, and the next thirty years? But it&rsquo;s so hot, and everything&rsquo;s so confused. Let&rsquo;s all go to town! Who wants to go to town? Ah, you look so cool. You always look so cool. You resemble the advertisement of the man."
ESFP,"You know the advertisement of the man ?? Are we just going to go? Like this? Aren&rsquo;t we going to let any one smoke a cigarette first? Oh, let&rsquo;s have fun, it&rsquo;s too hot to fuss."
ESFP,Where are we going? It&rsquo;s so hot. You go. We&rsquo;ll ride around and meet you after. We&rsquo;ll meet you on some corner. I&rsquo;ll be the man smoking two cigarettes.
ESFP,"Now see here, Tom, if you&rsquo;re going to make personal remarks I won&rsquo;t stay here a minute. Call up and order some ice for the mint julep. Still ? I was married in the middle of June, Louisville in June! Somebody fainted. Who was it fainted, Tom?"
ESFP,"Open the whiskey, Tom, and I&rsquo;ll make you a mint julep. Then you won&rsquo;t seem so stupid to yourself. . . . Look at the mint! He isn&rsquo;t causing a row. You&rsquo;re causing a row. Please have a little self-control. Please let&rsquo;s all go home. Why don&rsquo;t we all go home?"
ESFP,You&rsquo;re revolting. Do you know why we left Chicago? I&rsquo;m surprised that they didn&rsquo;t treat you to the story of that little spree.
ESFP,"Oh, you want too much! I love you now ? isn&rsquo;t that enough? I can&rsquo;t help what&rsquo;s past. I did love him once ? but I loved you too."
