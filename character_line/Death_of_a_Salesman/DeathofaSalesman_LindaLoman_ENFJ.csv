ENFJ,"Why? What happened? Did something happen, Willy? You didn&rsquo;t smash the car, did you? You didn&rsquo;t smash the car, did you?"
ENFJ,"Where were you all day? You look terrible. Oh. Maybe it was the steering again. I don&rsquo;t think Angelo knows the Studebaker. Maybe it&rsquo;s your glasses. You never went for your new glasses. Well, you&rsquo;ll just have to take a rest, Willy, you can&rsquo;t continue this way."
ENFJ,"But you didn&rsquo;t rest your mind. Your mind is overactive, and the mind is what counts, dear.  Take an aspirin. Should I get you an aspirin? It&rsquo;ll soothe you"
ENFJ,"Willy, dear. Talk to them again. There&rsquo;s no reason why you can&rsquo;t work in New York. But you&rsquo;re sixty years old. They can&rsquo;t expect you to keep travelling every week."
ENFJ,"Why don&rsquo;t you go down to the place tomorrow and tell Howard you&rsquo;ve simply got to work in New York? You&rsquo;re too accommodating, dear. Why don&rsquo;t you tell those things to Howard, dear?"
ENFJ,"They&rsquo;re sleeping. Happy took Biff on a date tonight.  It was so nice to see them shaving together, one behind the other, in the bathroom. And going out together. You no tice? The whole house smells of shaving lotion."
ENFJ,"Well, dear, life is a casting off. It&rsquo;s always that way. You shouldn&rsquo;t have criticised him, Willy, especially after he just got off the train. You mustn&rsquo;t lose your temper with him."
ENFJ,"He was crestfallen, Willy. You know how he admires you. I think if he finds himself, then you&rsquo;ll both be happier and not fight any more."
ENFJ,"They&rsquo;re sleeping. Get something to eat. Go on down. I don&rsquo;t know. I think he&rsquo;s still lost, Willy. I think he&rsquo;s very lost."
ENFJ,"You&rsquo;ve got too much on the ball to worry about.  Just try to relax, dear. You make mountains out of mole hills."
ENFJ,"And Willy ? if it&rsquo;s warm Sunday we&rsquo;ll drive in the coun try. And we&rsquo;ll open the windshield, and take lunch."
ENFJ,"Well, that&rsquo;s nothing. Something must&rsquo;ve reminded you. Be careful on the stairs, dear! The cheese is on the middle shelf."
ENFJ,"Hang them up on the line. And you better go down to your friends, Biff. The cellar is full of boys. They don&rsquo;t know what to do with themselves."
ENFJ,"Oh, the whole block&rsquo;ll be at that game. Did you sell any thing? No! Wait a minute, I&rsquo;ve got a pencil. That makes your commission... Two hundred... my God! Two hundred and twelve dollars!"
ENFJ,"Well, the man said that&rsquo;s the way it is. Till they work themselves in, y&rsquo;know. They got the biggest ads of any of them!"
ENFJ,"Well, there&rsquo;s nine-sixty for the washing machine. And for the vacuum cleaner there&rsquo;s three and a half due on the fif teenth. Then the roof, you got twenty-one dollars remaining. No, they did a wonderful job. Then you owe Frank for the carburetor."
ENFJ,"Well, you owe him three and a half. And odds and ends, comes to around a hundred and twenty dollars by the fifteenth. Well, next week you&rsquo;ll do better."
ENFJ,"But you&rsquo;re doing wonderful, dear. You&rsquo;re making seventy to a hundred dollars a week"
ENFJ,"illy, darling, you&rsquo;re the handsomest man in the world... To me you are. The handsomest. And the boys, Willy. Few men are idolized by their chil dren the way you are. You are, Willy. The handsomest man. You&rsquo;ve got no rea son to feel that."
ENFJ,"There&rsquo;s nothing to make up, dear. You&rsquo;re doing fine, bet ter than."
ENFJ,Just mending my stockings. They&rsquo;re so expensive.
ENFJ,"And he&rsquo;d better give back that football, Willy, it&rsquo;s not nice. He&rsquo;s too rough with the girls, Willy. All the mothers are afraid of him!"
ENFJ,Where&rsquo;ve you been all these years? Willy&rsquo;s always won dered why you¡¦
ENFJ,"Did you have some cheese? It&rsquo;s very late, darling. Come to bed, heh?  You coming in?"
ENFJ,"You pawned it, dear. Twelve, thirteen years ago. For Biffs radio correspondence course.  But in your slippers, Willy!"
ENFJ,"Don&rsquo;t, he&rsquo;ll hear you. It&rsquo;ll pass by morning. Oh, my dear, you should do a lot of things, but there&rsquo;s nothing to do, so go to sleep."
ENFJ,"How would I write to you? For over three months you had no address. I know, dear, I know. But he likes to have a letter. Just to know that there&rsquo;s still a possibility for better things.It&rsquo;s when you come home he&rsquo;s always the worst."
ENFJ,"When you write you&rsquo;re coming, he&rsquo;s all smiles, and talks about the future, and ? he&rsquo;s just wonderful. And then the closer you seem to come, the more shaky he gets, and then, by the time you get here, he&rsquo;s arguing, and he seems angry at you. I think it&rsquo;s just that maybe he can&rsquo;t bring himself to ? to open up to you. Why are you so hateful to each other? Why is that?"
ENFJ,But you no sooner come in the door than you&rsquo;re fighting!  Are you home to stay now?
ENFJ,"Biff, you can&rsquo;t look around all your life, can you? Biff, a man is not a bird, to come and go with the spring time.  Oh, it&rsquo;s been gray since you were in high school. I just stopped dyeing it, that&rsquo;s all."
ENFJ,You&rsquo;re such a boy! You think you can go away for a year and... You&rsquo;ve got to get it into your head now that one day you&rsquo;ll knock on this door and there&rsquo;ll be strange people here...
ENFJ,"Biff, dear, if you don&rsquo;t have any feeling for him, then you can&rsquo;t have any feeling for me."
ENFJ,"No. You can&rsquo;t just come to see me, because I love him. He&rsquo;s the dearest man in the world to me, and I won&rsquo;t have anyone making him feel unwanted and low and blue. You&rsquo;ve got to make up your mind now, darling, there&rsquo;s no leeway any more. Either he&rsquo;s your father and you pay him that respect, or else you&rsquo;re not to come here. I know he&rsquo;s not easy to get along with ? nobody knows that better than me ? but¡¦"
ENFJ,"Then make Charley your father, Biff. You can&rsquo;t do that, can you? I don&rsquo;t say he&rsquo;s a great man. Willy Loman never made a lot of money. His name was never in the paper. He&rsquo;s not the finest character that ever lived. But he&rsquo;s a human being, and a terrible thing is happening to him. So attention must be paid. He&rsquo;s not to be allowed to fall into his grave like an old dog. At tention, attention must be finally paid to such a person. You called him crazy¡¦"
ENFJ,"No, a lot of people think he¡¯s lost his ? balance. But you don¡¯t have to be very smart to know what his trouble is. The man is exhausted."
ENFJ,"A small man can be just as exhausted as a great man. He works for a company thirty-six years this March, opens up un heard-of territories to their trademark, and now in his old age they take his salary away."
ENFJ,"You never asked, my dear! Now that you get your spend ing money someplace else you don&rsquo;t trouble your mind with him."
ENFJ,"Christmas time, fifty dollars! To fix the hot water it cost ninety-seven fifty! For five weeks he&rsquo;s been on straight com mission, like a beginner, an unknown!"
ENFJ,"Are they any worse than his sons? When he brought them business, when he was young, they were glad to see him. But now his old friends, the old buyers that loved him so and al ways found some order to hand him in a pinch ? they&rsquo;re all dead, retired. He used to be able to make six, seven calls a day in Boston."
ENFJ,"Now he takes his valises out of the car and puts them back and takes them out again and he&rsquo;s exhausted. In stead of walking he talks now. He drives seven hundred miles, and when he gets there no one knows him any more, no one welcomes him."
ENFJ,"And what goes through a man&rsquo;s mind, driving seven hundred miles home without having earned a cent? Why shouldn&rsquo;t he talk to himself? Why? When he has to go to Char ley and borrow fifty dollars a week and pretend to me that it&rsquo;s his pay?"
ENFJ,"How long can that go on? How long? You see what I&rsquo;m sitting here and waiting for? And you tell me he has no charac ter? The man who never worked a day but for your benefit? When does he get the medal for that? Is this his reward ? to turn around at the age of sixty-three and find his sons, who he loved better than his life, one a philandering bum¡¦"
ENFJ,"That&rsquo;s all you are, my baby! And you! What happened to the love you had for him? You were such pals! How you used to talk to him on the phone every night! How lonely he was till he could come home to you!"
ENFJ,"No, Biff. You can&rsquo;t stay here and fight all the time."
ENFJ,The insurance inspector came. He said that they have evidence. That all these accidents in the last year ? weren&rsquo;t ? weren&rsquo;t ? accidents.
ENFJ,"Well, it seems she was walking down the road and saw his car. She says that he wasn&rsquo;t driving fast at all, and that he didn&rsquo;t skid. She says he came to that little bridge, and then de liberately smashed into the railing, and it was only the shal lowness of the water that saved him."
ENFJ,"Last month... Oh, boys, it&rsquo;s so hard to say a thing like this! He&rsquo;s just a big stupid man to you, but I tell you there&rsquo;s more good in him than in many other people. I was looking for a fuse. The lights blew out, and I went down the cellar. And behind the fuse box ? it happened to fall out ? was a length of rubber pipe ? just short."
ENFJ,"There&rsquo;s a little attachment on the end of it. I knew right away. And sure enough, on the bottom of the water heater there&rsquo;s a new little nipple on the gas pipe."
ENFJ,"I&rsquo;m ? I&rsquo;m ashamed to. How can I mention it to him? Every day I go down and take away that little rubber pipe. But, when he comes home, I put it back where it was. How can I in sult him that way? I don&rsquo;t know what to do. I live from day to day, boys. I tell you, I know every thought in his mind. It sounds so old-fashioned and silly, but I tell you he put his whole life into you and you&rsquo;ve turned your backs on him. Biff, I swear to God! Biff, his life is in your hands!"
ENFJ,What&rsquo;d you have to start that for? You see how sweet he was as soon as you talked hopefully? Come up and say good night to him. Don&rsquo;t let him go to bed that way.
ENFJ,"Please, dear. Just say good night. It takes so little to make him happy. Come. Your pajamas are hanging in the bathroom, Willy!"
ENFJ,Can you do anything about the shower? It drips.  I&rsquo;m just wondering if Oliver will remember him. You think he might?
ENFJ,"Just rest. Should I sing to you? Willy dear, what has he got against you?"
ENFJ, It was so thrilling to see them leaving together. I can&rsquo;t get over the shaving lotion in this house!
ENFJ, Biff was very changed this morning. His whole attitude seemed to be hopeful. He couldn&rsquo;t wait to get downtown to see Oliver
ENFJ,His blue suit. He&rsquo;s so handsome in that suit. He could be a ? anything in that suit!
ENFJ,That&rsquo;d be wonderful. But not enough sun gets back there. Nothing&rsquo;ll grow any more.
ENFJ,"He didn&rsquo;t mention it, but I imagine ten or fifteen thousand. You going to talk to Howard today?"
ENFJ,"And Willy, don&rsquo;t forget to ask for a little advance, because we&rsquo;ve got the insurance premium. It&rsquo;s the grace period now. A hundred and eight, sixty-eight. Because we&rsquo;re a little short again."
ENFJ,"All told, about two hundred dollars would carry us, dear. But that includes the last payment on the mortgage. After this payment, Willy, the house belongs to us."
ENFJ,"Biff came to me this morning, Willy, and he said, ?Tell Dad, we want to blow him to a big meal.? Be there six o&rsquo;clock. You and your two boys are going to have dinner."
ENFJ,"Hello? Oh, Biff. I&rsquo;m so glad you called, I just... Yes, sure, I just told him. Yes, he&rsquo;ll be there for dinner at six o&rsquo;clock, I didn&rsquo;t forget. Listen, I was just dying to tell you. You know that little rubber pipe I told you about? That he connected to the gas heater? I finally decided to go down the cellar this morning and take it away and destroy it. But it&rsquo;s gone! Imag ine? He took it away himself, it isn&rsquo;t there! When?"
ENFJ,"Oh, then you took it. Oh ? nothing, it&rsquo;s just that I&rsquo;d hoped he&rsquo;d taken it away himself. Oh, I&rsquo;m not worried, darling, be cause this morning he left in such high spirits, it was like the old days! I&rsquo;m not afraid any more. Did Mr. Oliver see you?... Well, you wait there then. And make a nice impression on him, darling. Just don&rsquo;t perspire too much before you see him. And have a nice time with Dad. He may have big news too!"
ENFJ,"That&rsquo;s right, a New York job. And be sweet to him tonight, dear. Be loving to him. Because he&rsquo;s only a little boat looking for a har bor. Oh, that&rsquo;s wonder ful, Biff, you&rsquo;ll save his life. Thanks, darling. Just put your arm around him when he comes into the restaurant. Give him a smile. That&rsquo;s the boy... Good-by, dear. You got your comb?... That&rsquo;s fine. Good-by, Biff dear."
ENFJ,"Don&rsquo;t say those things to him! Enough to be happy right here, right now. Why must everybody conquer the world? You&rsquo;re well liked, and the boys love you, and someday ?why, old man Wagner told him just the other day that if he keeps it up he&rsquo;ll be a member of the firm, didn&rsquo;t he, Willy?"
ENFJ,Don&rsquo;t you care whether he lives or dies? Get out of my sight! Get out of here!   You&rsquo;re not going near him!
ENFJ,You invite him for dinner. He looks forward to it all day ? and then you desert him there. There&rsquo;s no stranger you&rsquo;d do that to!
ENFJ,Did you have to go to women tonight? You and your lousy rotten whores!
ENFJ,"Get out of here, both of you, and don&rsquo;t come back! I don&rsquo;t want you tormenting him any more. Go on now, get your things together! You can sleep in his apartment.  Pick up this stuff, I&rsquo;m not your maid any more. Pick it up, you bum, you!"
ENFJ,"You&rsquo;re a pair of animals! Not one, not another living soul would have had the cruelty to walk out on the man in a restau rant!"
ENFJ,He didn&rsquo;t have to say anything. He was so humiliated he nearly limped when he came in.
ENFJ,"I think that&rsquo;s the best way, dear. &lsquo;Cause there&rsquo;s no use drawing it out, you&rsquo;ll just never get along."
ENFJ,"Be good. You&rsquo;re both good boys, just act that way, that&rsquo;s all.  I want you upstairs."
ENFJ,I can&rsquo;t understand it. At this time especially. First time in thirty-five years we were just about free and clear. He only needed a little salary. He was even finished with the dentist.
ENFJ,"Forgive me, dear. I can&rsquo;t cry. I don&rsquo;t know what it is, I can&rsquo;t cry. I don&rsquo;t understand it. Why did you ever do that? Help me Willy, I can&rsquo;t cry. It seems to me that you&rsquo;re just on another trip. I keep expecting you. Willy, dear, I can&rsquo;t cry. Why did you do it? I search and search and I search, and I can&rsquo;t understand it, Willy. I made the last payment on the house today. Today, dear. And there&rsquo;ll be nobody home. We&rsquo;re free and clear. We&rsquo;re free. We&rsquo;re free... We&rsquo;re free..."
