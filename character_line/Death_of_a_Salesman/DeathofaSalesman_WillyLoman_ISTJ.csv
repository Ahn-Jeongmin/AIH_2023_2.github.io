ISTJ," It&rsquo;s all right. I came back. No, nothing happened. You didn&rsquo;t smash the car, did you?  I&rsquo;m tired to the death. I couldn&rsquo;t make it. I just couldn&rsquo;t make it, Linda."
ISTJ," I got as far as a little above Yonkers. I stopped for a cup of coffee. Maybe it was the coffee.  I suddenly couldn&rsquo;t drive any more. The car kept going off onto the shoulder, y&rsquo;know?"
ISTJ,"No, it&rsquo;s me, it&rsquo;s me. Suddenly I realize I&rsquo;m goin&rsquo; sixty miles an hour and I don&rsquo;t remember the last five minutes. I&rsquo;m ? I can&rsquo;t seem to ? keep my mind to it. Maybe it&rsquo;s your glasses. You never went for your new glasses."
ISTJ,I&rsquo;ll start out in the morning. Maybe I&rsquo;ll feel better in the morning. These goddam arch supports are killing me.
ISTJ,"I was driving along, you understand? And I was fine. I was even observing the scenery. You can imagine, me looking at scenery, on the road every week of my life. But it&rsquo;s so beautiful up there, Linda, the trees are so thick, and the sun is warm. I opened the windshield and just let the warm air bathe over me."
ISTJ,"And then all of a sudden I&rsquo;m goin&rsquo; off the road! I&rsquo;m tellin&rsquo;ya, I absolutely forgot I was driving. If I&rsquo;d&rsquo;ve gone the other way over the white line I might&rsquo;ve killed somebody. So I went on again ? and five minutes later I&rsquo;m dreamin&rsquo; again, and I nearly... I have such thoughts, I have such strange thoughts."
ISTJ,"They don&rsquo;t need me in New York. I&rsquo;m the New England man. I&rsquo;m vital in New England. I&rsquo;ll have to send a wire to Portland. I&rsquo;m supposed to see Brown and Morrison tomorrow morning at ten o&rsquo;clock to show the line. Goddammit, I could sell them!"
ISTJ," If old man Wagner was alive I&rsquo;d a been in charge of New York now! That man was a prince, he was a masterful man. But that boy of his, that Howard, he don&rsquo;t appreciate. When I went north the first time, the Wagner Company didn&rsquo;t know where New England was!"
ISTJ," I will, I definitely will. Is there any cheese? No, go to sleep. I&rsquo;ll take some milk. I&rsquo;ll be up right away. The boys in?"
ISTJ,"Figure it out. Work a lifetime to pay off a house. You finally own it, and there&rsquo;s nobody to live in it. No, no, some people- some people accomplish something. Did Biff say anything after I went this morning?"
ISTJ,When the hell did I lose my temper? I simply asked him if he was making any money. Is that a criticism?  There&rsquo;s such an undercurrent in him. He became a moody man. Did he apologize when I left this morning?
ISTJ,"How can he find himself on a farm? Is that a life? A farm hand? In the beginning, when he was young, I thought, well, a young man, it&rsquo;s good for him to tramp around, take a lot of dif ferent jobs. But it&rsquo;s more than ten years now and he has yet to make thirty-five dollars a week!"
ISTJ," Not finding yourself at the age of thirty-four is a disgrace!  The trouble is he&rsquo;s lazy, goddammit! Biff is a lazy bum!"
ISTJ,"Why did he come home? I would like to know what brought him home. Biff Loman is lost. In the greatest country in the world a young man with such ? personal attractiveness, gets lost. And such a hard worker. There&rsquo;s one thing about Biff ? he&rsquo;s not lazy."
ISTJ,I&rsquo;ll see him in the morning; I&rsquo;ll have a nice talk with him. I&rsquo;ll get him a job selling. He could be big in no time. My God! Remember how they used to follow him around in high school? When he smiled at one of them their faces lit up. When he walked down the street...
ISTJ,"The street is lined with cars. There&rsquo;s not a breath of fresh air in the neighborhood. The grass don&rsquo;t grow any more, you can&rsquo;t raise a carrot in the back yard. They should&rsquo;ve had a law against apartment houses. Remember those two beautiful elm trees out there? When I and Biff hung the swing between them?"
ISTJ,"They should&rsquo;ve arrested the builder for cutting those down. They massacred the neighbourhood. More and more I think of those days, Linda. This time of year it was lilac and wisteria. And then the peonies would come out, and the daffodils. What fragrance in this room!"
ISTJ,There&rsquo;s more people! That&rsquo;s what&rsquo;s ruining this country! Population is getting out of control. The competition is mad dening! Smell the stink from that apartment house! And an other one on the other side... How can they whip cheese?
ISTJ,"You&rsquo;re not worried about me, are you, sweetheart?"
ISTJ,"I won&rsquo;t fight with him any more. If he wants to go back to Texas, let him go.  Sure. Certain men just don&rsquo;t get started till later in life. Like Thomas Edison; I think. Or B. F. Goodrich. One of them was deaf. I&rsquo;ll put my money on Biff."
ISTJ," I was thinking of the Chevvy. Nineteen twenty-eight ... when I had that red Chevvy... That funny? I coulda sworn I was driving that Chevvy today. Remarkable. Ts. Remember those days? The way Biff used to simonize that car? The dealer refused to believe there was eighty thousand miles on it. Close your eyes, I&rsquo;ll be right up"
ISTJ,"You gonna wash the engine, Biff? Don&rsquo;t get your sweater dirty, Biff!  What a simonizing job! No kiddin&rsquo;, Biff, you got a date? Wonderful!"
ISTJ,"Just wanna be careful with those girls, Biff, that&rsquo;s all. Don&rsquo;t make any promises. No promises of any kind. Because a girl, y&rsquo;know, they always believe what you tell &lsquo;em, and you&rsquo;re very young, Biff, you&rsquo;re too young to be talking seriously to girls."
ISTJ,"Too young entirely, Biff. You want to watch your school ing first. Then when you&rsquo;re all set, there&rsquo;ll be plenty of girls for a boy like you. That so? The girls pay for you? Boy, you must really be makin&rsquo; a hit."
ISTJ," I been wondering why you polish the car so careful. Ha! Don&rsquo;t leave the hubcaps, boys. Get the chamois to the hubcaps. Happy, use newspaper on the windows, it&rsquo;s the easiest thing. Show him how to do it Biff! You see, Happy? Pad it up, use it like a pad. That&rsquo;s it, that&rsquo;s it, good work."
ISTJ,"You&rsquo;re doin&rsquo; all right, Hap. Biff, first thing we gotta do when we get time is clip that big branch over the house. Afraid it&rsquo;s gonna fall in a storm and hit the roof. Tell you what. We get a rope and sling her around, and then we climb up there with a couple of saws and take her down. Soon as you finish the car, boys, I wanna see ya. I got a surprise for you, boys."
ISTJ,"No, you finish first. Never leave a job till you&rsquo;re finished ? remember that. Biff, up in Albany I saw a beautiful hammock. I think I&rsquo;ll buy it next trip, and we&rsquo;ll hang it right between those two elms. Wouldn&rsquo;t that be something? Just swingin&rsquo; there under those branches. Boy, that would be..."
ISTJ,"That&rsquo;s because he likes you. If somebody else took that ball there&rsquo;d be an uproar. So what&rsquo;s the report, boys, what&rsquo;s the report?"
ISTJ,"Don&rsquo;t say? Tell you a secret, boys. Don&rsquo;t breathe it to a soul. Someday I&rsquo;ll have my own business, and I&rsquo;ll never have to leave home any more. Bigger than Uncle Charley! Because Charley is not ? liked. He&rsquo;s liked, but he&rsquo;s not ? well liked."
ISTJ,"Well, I got on the road, and I went north to Providence. Met the Mayor. He said, ?Morning!? And I said, ?You got a fine city here, Mayor.? And then he had coffee with me. And then I went to Waterbury. Waterbury is a fine city. Big clock city, the famous Waterbury clock. Sold a nice bill there."
ISTJ,"And then Boston ? Boston is the cradle of the Revolution. A fine city. And a couple of other towns in Mass., and on to Portland and Bangor and straight home!"
ISTJ,"ou and Hap and I, and I&rsquo;ll show you all the towns. America is full of beautiful towns and fine, upstanding people. And they know me, boys, they know me up and down New England. The finest people."
ISTJ,"And when I bring you fellas up, there&rsquo;ll be open sesame for all of us, &lsquo;cause one thing, boys: I have friends. I can park my car in any street in New England, and the cops protect it like their own. This summer, heh?"
ISTJ,"Oh, won&rsquo;t that be something! Me comin&rsquo; into the Boston stores with you boys carryin&rsquo; my bags. What a sensation!"
ISTJ,"What&rsquo;re you talking about? With scholarships to three universities they&rsquo;re gonna flunk him? Don&rsquo;t be a pest, Bernard!  What an anemic!"
ISTJ,"That&rsquo;s just what I mean. Bernard can get the best marks in school, y&rsquo;understand, but when he gets out in the business world, y&rsquo;understand, you are going to be five times ahead of him. That&rsquo;s why I thank Almighty God you&rsquo;re both built like Adonises"
ISTJ,"Because the man who makes an appearance in the business world, the man who creates personal interest, is the man who gets ahead. Be liked and you will never want. You take me, for instance. I never have to wait in line to see a buyer. ?Willy Loman is here!? That&rsquo;s all they have to know, and I go right through."
ISTJ,"Knocked &lsquo;em cold in Providence, slaughtered &lsquo;em in Bos ton."
ISTJ,"Well, that&rsquo;s training, the training. I&rsquo;m tellin&rsquo; you, I was sellin&rsquo; thousands and thousands, but I had to come home. I did five hundred gross in Providence and seven hundred gross in Boston."
ISTJ,"Well, I ? I did ? about a hundred and eighty gross in Providence. Well, no ? it came to ? roughly two hundred gross on the whole trip.The trouble was that three of the stores were half-closed for inventory in Boston. Otherwise I woulda broke records."
ISTJ,"I&rsquo;m not going to pay that man! That goddam Chevrolet, they ought to prohibit the manufacture oft hat car! A hundred and twenty dollars! My God, if business don&rsquo;t pick up I don&rsquo;t know what I&rsquo;m gonna do!"
ISTJ,"Oh, I&rsquo;ll knock &lsquo;em dead next week. I&rsquo;ll go to Hartford. I&rsquo;m very well liked in Hartford. You know, the trouble is, Linda, people don&rsquo;t seem to take to me. I know it when I walk in. They seem to laugh at me"
ISTJ," I don&rsquo;t know the reason for it, but they just pass me by. I&rsquo;m not noticed. But I gotta be at it ten, twelve hours a day. Other men ? I don&rsquo;t know ? they do it easier. I don&rsquo;t know why ? I can&rsquo;t stop myself ? I talk too much. A man oughta come in with a few words. One thing about Charley. He&rsquo;s a man of few words, and they respect him."
ISTJ,"I&rsquo;m fat. I&rsquo;m very ? foolish to look at, Linda. I didn&rsquo;t tell you, but Christmas time I happened to be calling on F. H. Stewarts, and a salesman I know, as I was going in to see the buyer I heard him say something about ? walrus. And I ? I cracked him right across the face. I won&rsquo;t take that. I simply will not take that. But they do laugh at me. I know that."
ISTJ," I gotta overcome it. I know I gotta overcome it. I&rsquo;m not dressing to advantage, maybe."
ISTJ,"You&rsquo;re the best there is, Linda, you&rsquo;re a pal, you know that? On the road ? on the road I want to grab you sometimes and just kiss the life outa you."
ISTJ,"Cause I get so lonely ? especially when business is bad and there&rsquo;s nobody to talk to. I get the feeling that I&rsquo;ll never sell anything again, that I won&rsquo;t make a living for you, or a business, a business for the boys. There&rsquo;s so much I want to make for..."
ISTJ,"I&rsquo;ll make it all up to you, Linda, I&rsquo;ll... I won&rsquo;t have you mending stockings in this house! Now throw them out!"
ISTJ,"There&rsquo;s nothing the matter with him! You want him to be a worm like Bernard? He&rsquo;s got spirit, per sonality"
ISTJ,"Loaded with it. Loaded! What is he stealing? He&rsquo;s giving it back, isn&rsquo;t he? Why is he stealing? What did I tell him? I never in my life told him anything but decent things."
ISTJ,Huh! Why did she have to wax the floors herself? Everytime she waxes the floors she keels over. She knows that!
ISTJ,"I got an awful scare. Nearly hit a kid in Yonkers. God! Why didn&rsquo;t I go to Alaska with my brother Ben that time! Ben! That man was a genius, that man was success incarnate! What a mistake! He begged me to go."
ISTJ,"You guys! There was a man started with the clothes on his back and ended up with diamond mines! What&rsquo;s the mystery? The man knew what he wanted and went out and got it! Walked into a jungle, and comes out, the age of twenty-one, and he&rsquo;s rich! The world is an oyster, but you don&rsquo;t crack it open on a mattress!"
ISTJ,"You&rsquo;ll retire me for life on seventy goddam dollars a week? And your women and your car and your apartment, and you&rsquo;ll retire me for life! Christ&rsquo;s sake, I couldn&rsquo;t get past Yonkers today! Where are you guys, where are you? The woods are burning! I can&rsquo;t drive a car!"
ISTJ,"You go ahead, I&rsquo;m not tired at the moment. No, you&rsquo;re ignorant. You gotta know about vitamins and things like that."
ISTJ,What are you talkin&rsquo; about? Do you know the first thing about it? Don&rsquo;t talk about something you don&rsquo;t know anything about.
ISTJ,"I can&rsquo;t understand it. He&rsquo;s go ing back to Texas again. What the hell is that?  I got nothin&rsquo; to give him, Charley, I&rsquo;m clean, I&rsquo;m clean."
ISTJ,"That&rsquo;s funny. For a second there you reminded me of my brother Ben. Didn&rsquo;t Linda tell you? Couple of weeks ago we got a letter from his wife in Africa. He died. Naa, he had seven sons. There&rsquo;s just one opportunity I had with that man..."
ISTJ,"Sure, sure! If I&rsquo;d gone with him to Alaska that time, everything would&rsquo;ve been totally different. There was the only man I ever met who knew the an swers."
ISTJ,"What do you mean, who died?  That&rsquo;s my build!  If you don&rsquo;t know how to play the game I&rsquo;m not gonna throw my money away on you! I&rsquo;m through, I&rsquo;m through!"
ISTJ,Long ago. Since the beginning you never knew how to play cards. I don&rsquo;t play that kind of game!  Ben! I&rsquo;ve been waiting for you so long! What&rsquo;s the answer? How did you do it?
ISTJ,Where is Dad? Didn&rsquo;t you follow him? How did you get started?
ISTJ,"Well, I was just a baby, of course, only three or four years old... What a memory, Ben! I remember I was sitting under the wagon in ? was it Nebraska? I remember you walking away down some open road."
ISTJ,"No! Boys! Boys! Listen to this. This is your Uncle Ben, a great man! Tell my boys, Ben!  You see what I been talking about? The greatest things can happen!"
ISTJ,"No, Ben! Please tell about Dad. I want my boys to hear. I want them to know the kind of stock they spring from. All I remember is a man with a big beard, and I was in Mamma&rsquo;s lap, sitting around a fire, and some kind of high music."
ISTJ,"That&rsquo;s just the way I&rsquo;m bringing them up, Ben ? rugged, well liked, all-around."
ISTJ,"Oh, sure, there&rsquo;s snakes and rabbits and ? that&rsquo;s why I moved out here. Why Biff can fell any one of these trees in no time! Boys! Go right over to where they&rsquo;re building the apart ment house and get some sand. We&rsquo;re gonna rebuild the entire front stoop right now! Watch this, Ben!"
ISTJ,You shoulda seen the lumber they brought home last week. At least a dozen six-by-tens worth all kinds a money.
ISTJ,"There&rsquo;s nothing wrong. What&rsquo;s the matter with you?  Oh, nerves of iron, that Biff! It&rsquo;s contacts, Charley, I got important contacts! Business is bad, it&rsquo;s murderous. But not for me, of course."
ISTJ,Now all you need is a golf club and you can go upstairs and go to sleep. Great athlete! Between him and his son Bernard they can&rsquo;t hammer a nail!
ISTJ,"Can&rsquo;t you stay a few days? You&rsquo;re just what I need, Ben, because I ? I have a fine position here, but I ? well, Dad left when I was such a baby and I never had a chance to talk to him and I still feel ? kind of temporary about myself."
ISTJ,"Ben, my boys ? can&rsquo;t we talk? They&rsquo;d go into the jaws of hell for me see, but I... Oh, Ben, that&rsquo;s good to hear! Because sometimes I&rsquo;m afraid that I&rsquo;m not teaching them the right kind of ? Ben, how should I teach them?"
ISTJ,...was rich! That&rsquo;s just the spirit I want to imbue them with! To walk into a jungle! I was right! I was right! I was right!
ISTJ,"Gotta break your neck to see a star in this yard. Whatever happened to that diamond watch fob? Remember? When Ben came from Africa that time? Didn&rsquo;t he give me a watch fob with a diamond in it? Gee, that was a beautiful thing. I&rsquo;ll take a walk."
ISTJ,"Even your grandfather was better than a carpenter. You never grew up. Bernard does not whistle in the elevator, I assure you."
ISTJ,"I never in my life whistled in an elevator! And who in the business world thinks I&rsquo;m crazy? Go back to the West! Be a carpenter, a cowboy, enjoy yourself!"
ISTJ,"They laugh at me, heh? Go to Filene&rsquo;s, go to the Hub, go to Slattery&rsquo;s, Boston. Call out the name Willy Loman and see what happens! Big shot!"
ISTJ," If you get tired hanging around tomorrow, paint the ceiling I put up in the living room."
ISTJ,Don&rsquo;t interrupt. What&rsquo;s wonderful about it? There&rsquo;s fifty men in the City of New York who&rsquo;d stake him. (To Biff.) Sport ing goods?
ISTJ,"He knows something about it! You know sporting goods better than Spalding, for God&rsquo;s sake! How much is he giving you?"
ISTJ,Lick the world! You guys together could absolutely lick the civilized world.
ISTJ,"Will you stop! Walk in very serious. You are not applying for a boy&rsquo;s job. Money is to pass. Be quiet, fine, and serious. Everybody likes a kidder, but nobody lends him money."
ISTJ,"I see great things for you kids, I think your troubles are over. But remember, start big and you&rsquo;ll end big. Ask for fif teen. How much you gonna ask for?"
ISTJ,"Don&rsquo;t be so modest. You always started too low. Walk in with a big laugh. Don&rsquo;t look worried. Start off with a couple of your good stones to lighten things up. It&rsquo;s not what you say, it&rsquo;s how you say it ? because personality always wins the day."
ISTJ,"Remember him? What&rsquo;s the matter with you, you crazy? If he&rsquo;d&rsquo;ve stayed with Oliver he&rsquo;d be on top by now! Wait&rsquo;ll Oliver gets a look at him. You don&rsquo;t know the average caliber any more. The average young man today ? is got a cali ber of zero. Greatest thing in the world for him was to bum around."
ISTJ,And if anything falls off the desk while you&rsquo;re talking to him ? like a package or something ? don&rsquo;t you pick it up. They have office boys for that.
ISTJ,"Because you got a greatness in you, Biff, remember that. You got all kinds a greatness・"
ISTJ,"Like a young god. Hercules ? something like that. And the sun, the sun all around him. Remember how he waved to me? Right up from the field, with the representatives of three colleges standing by? And the buyers I brought, and the cheers when he came out ? Loman, Loman, Loman! God Almighty, he&rsquo;ll be great yet. A star like that, magnificent, can never really fade away!"
ISTJ,"I slept like a dead one. First time in months. Imagine, sleeping till ten on a Tuesday morning. Boys left nice and early, heh?"
ISTJ,"He&rsquo;s heading for a change. There&rsquo;s no question, there simply are certain men that take longer to get ? solidified. How did he dress? There&rsquo;s no question, no question at all. Gee, on the way home tonight I&rsquo;d like to buy some seeds."
ISTJ,"You wait, kid, before it&rsquo;s all over we&rsquo;re gonna get a little place out in the country, and I&rsquo;ll raise some vegetables, a cou ple of chickens.."
ISTJ,"And they&rsquo;ll get married, and come for a weekend. I&rsquo;d build a little guest house. &lsquo;Cause I got so many fine tools, all I&rsquo;d need would be a little lumber and some peace of mind."
ISTJ,"I could build two guest houses, so they&rsquo;d both come. Did he decide how much he&rsquo;s going to ask Oliver for?   Yeah. I&rsquo;ll put it to him straight and simple. He&rsquo;ll just have to take me off the road"
ISTJ,"I told you we should&rsquo;ve bought a well-advertised machine. Charley bought a General Electric and it&rsquo;s twenty years old and it&rsquo;s still good, that son-of-a-bitch."
ISTJ,"Whoever heard of a Hastings refrigerator? Once in my life I would like to own something outright before it&rsquo;s broken! I&rsquo;m always in a race with the junkyard! I just finished paying for the car and it&rsquo;s on its last legs. The refrigerator consumes belts like a goddam maniac. They time those things. They time them so when you finally paid for them, they&rsquo;re used up."
ISTJ,"All the cement, the lumber, the reconstruction I put in this house! There ain&rsquo;t a crack to be found in it any more. What purpose? Some stranger&rsquo;ll come along, move in, and that&rsquo;s that. If only Biff would take this house, and raise a fam ily...  Good-by, I&rsquo;m late."
ISTJ,"Gee whiz! That&rsquo;s really somethin&rsquo;. I&rsquo;m gonna knock Howard for a loop, kid. I&rsquo;ll get an advance, and I&rsquo;ll come home with a New York job. Goddammit, now I&rsquo;m gonna do it!"
ISTJ,Will you stop mending stockings? At least while I&rsquo;m in the house. It gets me nervous. I can&rsquo;t tell you. Please.
ISTJ,"I&rsquo;m definitely going to get one. Because lots of times I&rsquo;m on the road, and I think to myself, what I must be missing on the radio!"
ISTJ,"That&rsquo;s what I want to talk to you about, Howard. You got a minute?  Well, tell you the truth, Howard. I&rsquo;ve come to the deci sion that I&rsquo;d rather not travel any more."
ISTJ,"Remember, Christmas time, when you had the party here? You said you&rsquo;d try to think of some spot for me here in town."
ISTJ,"I tell ya, Howard. The kids are all grown up, y&rsquo;know. I don&rsquo;t need much any more. If I could take home ? well, sixty five dollars a week, I could swing it.   I tell ya why. Howard. Speaking frankly and between the two of us, y&rsquo;know ? I&rsquo;m just a little tired."
ISTJ,"God knows, Howard. I never asked a favor of any man. But I was with the firm when your father used to carry you in here in his arms."
ISTJ,"Your father came to me the day you were born and asked me what I thought of the name of Howard, may he rest in peace. Howard, all I need to set my table is fifty dollars a week.  Look, it isn&rsquo;t a question of whether I can sell merchan dise, is it?"
ISTJ,"Business is definitely business, but just listen for a minute. You don&rsquo;t understand this. When I was a boy ? eighteen, nineteen ? I was already on the road. And there was a question in my mind as to whether selling had a future for me. Because in those days I had a yearning to go to Alaska. See, there were three gold strikes in one month in Alaska, and I felt like going out. Just for the ride, you might say."
ISTJ,"Oh, yeah, my father lived many years in Alaska. He was an adventurous man. We&rsquo;ve got quite a little streak of self reliance in our family. I thought I&rsquo;d go out with my older brother and try to locate him, and maybe settle in the North with the old man. And I was almost decided to go, when I met a salesman in the Parker House."
ISTJ,"is name was Dave Singleman. And he was eighty-four years old, and he&rsquo;d drummed mer chandise in thirty-one states. And old Dave, he&rsquo;d go up to his room, y&rsquo;understand, put on his green velvet slippers ? I&rsquo;ll never forget ? and pick up his phone and call the buyers, and without ever leaving his room, at the age of eighty-four, he made his living."
ISTJ,"And when I saw that, I realized that selling was the greatest career a man could want. &lsquo;Cause what could be more satisfying than to be able to go, at the age of eighty four, into twenty or thirty different cities, and pick up a phone, and be remembered and loved and helped by so many different people?"
ISTJ,"Do you know? When he died ? and by the way he died the death of a salesman, in his green velvet slippers in the smoker of the New York, New Haven and Hartford, going into Boston ? when he died, hundreds of salesmen and buyers were at his funeral."
ISTJ,"Things were sad on a lotta trains for months af ter that. In those days there was personality in it, Howard. There was re spect, and comradeship, and gratitude in it. Today, it&rsquo;s all cut and dried, and there&rsquo;s no chance for bringing friendship to bear ? or personality. You see what I mean? They don&rsquo;t know me any more."
ISTJ,"I&rsquo;m talking about your father! There were promises made across this desk! You mustn&rsquo;t tell me you&rsquo;ve got people to see ? I put thirty-four years into this firm, Howard, and now I can&rsquo;t pay my insurance! You can&rsquo;t eat the orange and throw the peel away ? a man is not a piece of fruit! Now pay attention. Your father ? in 1928 I had a big year. I averaged a hundred and seventy dollars a week in com missions."
ISTJ,"I averaged a hundred and seventy dollars a week in the year of 1928! And your father came to me ? or rather, I was in the office here ? it was right over this desk ? and he put his hand on my shoulder..."
ISTJ,"Pull myself together! What the hell did I say to him? My God, I was yelling at him! How could I?  Frank, Frank, don&rsquo;t you remember what you told me that time? How you put your hand on my shoulder, and Frank・"
ISTJ,"Sure, sure. I am building something with this firm, Ben, and if a man is building something he must be on the right track, mustn&rsquo;t he?"
ISTJ,"That&rsquo;s right, Ben, that&rsquo;s right. When I look at that man I say, what is there to worry about? It&rsquo;s true, Ben. All he has to do is go into any city, pick up the phone, and he&rsquo;s making his living and you know why?"
ISTJ,"Without a penny to his name, three great universities are begging for him, and from there the sky&rsquo;s the limit, because it&rsquo;s not what you do, Ben. It&rsquo;s who you know and the smile on your face! It&rsquo;s contacts, Ben, contacts! The whole wealth of Alaska passes over the lunch table at the Commodore Hotel, and that&rsquo;s the wonder, the wonder of this country, that a man can end with diamonds here on the basis of being liked!"
ISTJ,"And that&rsquo;s why when you get out on that field today it&rsquo;s important. Because thousands of people will be rooting for you and loving you. And Ben! When he walks into a business office his name will sound out like a bell and all the doors will open to him! I&rsquo;ve seen it, Ben, I&rsquo;ve seen it a thousand times! You can&rsquo;t feel it with your hand like timber, but it&rsquo;s there!"
ISTJ,"Yeah, heh? When this game is over, Charley, you&rsquo;ll be laughing out of the other side of your face. They&rsquo;ll be calling him another Red Grange. Twenty-five thousand a year."
ISTJ,"Who the hell do you think you are, better than everybody else? You don&rsquo;t know everything, you big, ignorant, stupid... Put up your hands!"
ISTJ,What are you walking away for? Don&rsquo;t walk away! If you&rsquo;re going to say something say it to my face! I know you laugh at me behind my back. You&rsquo;ll laugh out of the other side of your goddam face after this game. Touchdown! Touch down! Eighty thousand people! Touchdown! Right between the goal posts.
ISTJ,"Well, he&rsquo;s been doing very big things in the West. But he decided to establish himself here. Very big. We&rsquo;re having din ner. Did I hear your wife had a boy?"
ISTJ,"Well, Bill Oliver ? very big sporting-goods man ? he wants Biff very badly. Called him in from the West. Long dis tance, carte blanche, special deliveries. Your friends have their own private tennis court?"
ISTJ,"I&rsquo;m ? I&rsquo;m overjoyed to see how you made the grade, Bernard, overjoyed. It&rsquo;s an encouraging thing to see a young man really ? really... Looks very good for Biff ? very... Bernard ..."
ISTJ,"You were his friend, his boy hood friend. There&rsquo;s something I don&rsquo;t understand about it. His life ended after that Ebbets Field game. From the age of seventeen nothing good ever happened to him"
ISTJ,"But he did, he did. After high school he took so many correspondence courses. Radio mechanics; television; God knows what, and never made the slightest mark."
ISTJ,"Why? Why! Bernard, that question has been trailing me like a ghost for the last fifteen years. He flunked the subject, and laid down and died like a hammer hit him!"
ISTJ,"Let me talk to you ? I got nobody to talk to. Bernard, Bernard, was it my fault? Y&rsquo;see? It keeps going around in my mind, maybe I did something to him. I got nothing to give him. Why did he lay down? What is the story there? You were his friend!"
ISTJ,"I&rsquo;ve always tried to think otherwise, I guess. I always felt that if a man was impressive, and well liked, that nothing.."
ISTJ,"Funny, y&rsquo;know? After all the high ways, and the trains, and the appointments, and the years, you end up worth more dead than alive."
ISTJ,"Apologize to Bernard for me when you see him. I didn&rsquo;t mean to argue with him. He&rsquo;s a fine boy. They&rsquo;re all fine boys, and they&rsquo;ll end up big ? all of them. Someday they&rsquo;ll all play tennis together. Wish me luck, Charley. He saw Bill Oliver to day."
ISTJ,"I&rsquo;m not interested in stories about the past or any crap of that kind because the woods are burning, boys, you under stand? There&rsquo;s a big blaze going on all around. I was fired to day."
ISTJ," I was fired, and I&rsquo;m looking for a little good news to tell your mother, because the woman has waited and the woman has suffered. The gist of it is that I haven&rsquo;t got a story left in my head, Biff. So don&rsquo;t give me a lecture about facts and as pects. I am not interested. Now what&rsquo;ve you got to say to me?"
ISTJ,"I was wondering if he&rsquo;d remember you. (To Happy.) Imagine, man doesn&rsquo;t see him for ten, twelve years and gives him that kind of a welcome!"
ISTJ,"You know why he remembered you, don&rsquo;t you? Because you impressed him in those days. Well, what hap pened? It&rsquo;s great news, Biff. Did he take you into his office or&rsquo;d you talk in the waiting room?"
ISTJ,"All right, stay in the bath room here, and don&rsquo;t come out. I think there&rsquo;s a law in Massa chusetts about it, so don&rsquo;t come out. It may be that new room clerk. He looked very mean. So don&rsquo;t come out. It&rsquo;s a mistake, there&rsquo;s no fire."
ISTJ," I just heard you. I was in the bathroom and had the door shut. Did anything happen home? Biffo, what&rsquo;s this about? Come on, let&rsquo;s go downstairs and get you a malted."
ISTJ,"Ah ? you better go back to your room. They must be finished painting by now. They&rsquo;re painting her room so I let her take a shower here. Go back, go back・"
ISTJ,"Get out of here! Go back, go back... This is Miss Francis, Biff, she&rsquo;s a buyer. They&rsquo;re painting her room. Go back, Miss Francis, go back・"
ISTJ,"Well, better get going. I want to get to the school first thing in the morning. Get my suits out of the closet. I&rsquo;ll get my valise. What&rsquo;s the matter! She&rsquo;s a buyer. Buys for J. H. Simmons. She lives down the hall ? they&rsquo;re painting. You don&rsquo;t imagine ?   Now listen, pal, she&rsquo;s just a buyer."
ISTJ,"She sees merchandise in her room and they have to keep it looking just so... All right, get my suits. Now stop crying and do as I say. I gave you an order. Biff, I gave you an order! Is that what you do when I give you an order? How dare you cry! Now look, Biff, when you grow up you&rsquo;ll understand about these things. You mustn&rsquo;t ? you mustn&rsquo;t overemphasize a thing like this. I&rsquo;ll see Birn baum first thing in the morning."
ISTJ,"Oh, I&rsquo;d better hurry. I&rsquo;ve got to get some seeds. I&rsquo;ve got to get some seeds, right away. Nothing&rsquo;s planted. I don&rsquo;t have a thing in the ground."
ISTJ,"Carrots... quarter-inch apart. Rows... one-foot rows. One foot. Lettuce. One foot ? What a proposition, ts, ts. Terrific, terrific. &lsquo;Cause she&rsquo;s suffered, Ben, the woman has suffered. You un derstand me? A man can&rsquo;t go out the way, he came in, Ben, a man has got to add up to something. You can&rsquo;t, you can&rsquo;t ? You gotta con sider, now."
ISTJ,"Don&rsquo;t answer so quick. Remember, it&rsquo;s a guaran teed twenty-thousand-dollar proposition. Now look, Ben, I want you to go through the ins and outs of this thing with me. I&rsquo;ve got nobody to talk to, Ben, and the woman has suffered, you hear me?"
ISTJ,How can they dare refuse? Didn&rsquo;t I work like a coolie to meet every premium on the nose? And now they don&rsquo;t pay off? Impossible!
ISTJ,"Oh, Ben, that&rsquo;s the whole beauty of it! I see it like a diamond, shining in the dark, hard and rough, that I can pick up and touch in my hand. Not like ? like an appointment! This would not be another damned-fool appointment, Ben, and it changes all the aspects. Because he thinks I&rsquo;m nothing, see, and so he spites me. But the funeral... Ben, that funeral will be mas sive!"
ISTJ,"They&rsquo;ll come from Maine, Massachusetts, Vermont, New Hampshire! All the oldtimers with the strange license plates ? that boy will be thunderstruck, Ben, because he never realized ? I am known! Rhode Island, New York, New Jersey ? I am known, Ben, and he&rsquo;ll see it with his eyes once and for all. He&rsquo;ll see what I am, Ben! He&rsquo;s in for a shock, that boy!"
ISTJ,"Oh, Ben, how do we get back to all the great times? Used to be so full of light, and comradeship, the sleigh-riding in win ter, and the ruddiness on his cheeks. And always some kind of good news coming up, always something nice coming up ahead. And never even let me carry the valises in the house, and si monizing, simonizing that little red car! Why, why can&rsquo;t I give him something and not have him hate me?"
ISTJ," I want you to know, on the train, in the mountains, in the valleys, wherever you go, that you cut down your life for spite!"
ISTJ,"Spite, spite, is the word of your undoing! And when you&rsquo;re down and out, remember what did it. When you&rsquo;re rot ting somewhere beside the railroad tracks, remember, and don&rsquo;t you dare blame it on me!"
ISTJ,You&rsquo;re trying to put a knife in me ? don&rsquo;t think I don&rsquo;t know what you&rsquo;re doing!
ISTJ,"I just want to get settled down, Linda. Let me sit alone for a little.  In a few minutes, Linda. I couldn&rsquo;t sleep right now. Go on, you look awful tired."
ISTJ,"The only way. Everything is gonna be ? go on, kid, get to bed. You look so tired."
ISTJ,"Loves me. Always loved me. Isn&rsquo;t that a remarkable thing? Ben, he&rsquo;ll worship me for it!  Can you imagine that magnificence with twenty thou sand dollars in his pocket?"
ISTJ,"Yes! Yes. Coming! It&rsquo;s very smart, you realize that, don&rsquo;t you, sweetheart? Even Ben sees it. I gotta go, baby. &lsquo;By! &lsquo;By!  Imagine? When the mail comes he&rsquo;ll be ahead of Bernard again!"
ISTJ,"Now when you kick off, boy, I want a seventy-yard boot, and get right down the field under the ball, and when you hit, hit low and hit hard, because it&rsquo;s important, boy. There&rsquo;s all kinds of important people in the stands, and the first thing you know... Ben! Ben, where do I... ?  Ben, how do I... ?"
